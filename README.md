**Scheduler NYU**

**Description**

Our project is to create interactive scheduler that takes data from albert classes and render it to a database. The user can create their schedule by selecting the class and having it displayed on a scheduler.

*History*

Initially, we were developing an virtual NYU card that can use phone signals to trigger responses on the NYU building readers. However, due to restrictions, we were not able to develop such a program. 
We then thought of what services that could have been improved on and we thought that selecting classes on NYU was not a smooth process. We would like to expedite the process by creating a interactive scheduler.

TODO: Update later
