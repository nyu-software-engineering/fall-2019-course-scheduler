In this course, we will examine some of the ways in which medicine is ‘value-laden’, and in which our political commitments may inform our medical practices. We will ask questions like: how do we define health and disease? How do we draw the line between mental illness and mere mental difference? What role should a medical professional’s personal values play in their practice? Should doctors have a right to refuse to perform medical procedures that violate their personal moral commitments? To what extent should medical systems accommodate patients’ religious and cultural practices? We will address these questions, among others, by reading work from philosophy, political theory, and by examining case studies.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:12:56.292Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:12:56.292Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbbbb20bd11405a8219e8","name":"Independent Study","location":"Room: TBA Loc: Washington Square","school":"Coll of Global Public Health - Grad","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":7414,"department":"[object Promise] (Global Public Health)","description":"\n\nOpen to MPH students only.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:12:59.839Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:12:59.839Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbbbf20bd11405a8219e9","name":"Independent Study","location":"Room: TBA Loc: Washington Square","school":"Coll of Global Public Health - Grad","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":7415,"department":"[object Promise] (Global Public Health)","description":"\n\nOpen to MPH students only.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:03.399Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:03.399Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbbc220bd11405a8219ea","name":"Independent Study","location":"Room: TBA Loc: Washington Square","school":"Coll of Global Public Health - Grad","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":7416,"department":"[object Promise] (Global Public Health)","description":"\n\nOpen to MPH students only.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:06.929Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:06.929Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbbc620bd11405a8219eb","name":"Independent Study","location":"Room: TBA Loc: Washington Square","school":"Coll of Global Public Health - Grad","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":7417,"department":"[object Promise] (Global Public Health)","description":"\n\nOpen to MPH students only.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:10.338Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:10.338Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbbc920bd11405a8219ec","name":"Independent Study","location":"Room: TBA Loc: Washington Square","school":"Coll of Global Public Health - Grad","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":7418,"department":"[object Promise] (Global Public Health)","description":"\n\nOpen to MPH students only.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:13.887Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:13.887Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbbcd20bd11405a8219ed","name":"Independent Study","location":"Room: TBA Loc: Washington Square","school":"Coll of Global Public Health - Grad","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":7427,"department":"[object Promise] (Global Public Health)","description":"\n\nOpen to MPH students only.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:17.376Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:17.376Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbbd120bd11405a8219ee","name":"Independent Study","location":"Room: TBA Loc: Washington Square","school":"Coll of Global Public Health - Grad","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":7544,"department":"[object Promise] (Global Public Health)","description":"null","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:21.043Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:21.043Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbbd420bd11405a8219ef","name":"Independent Study","location":"Room: TBA Loc: Washington Square","school":"Coll of Global Public Health - Grad","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":7545,"department":"[object Promise] (Global Public Health)","description":"null","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:24.848Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:24.848Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbbd820bd11405a8219f0","name":"Microeconomics for Public Management, Planning & Policy Analysis","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:401 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Coll of Global Public Health - Grad","units":3,"time":"Tu 6:45PM - 9:30PM","course_number":7446,"department":"[object Promise] (Global Public Health)","description":"\n\nOpen to MPH students in GH, PHPM, and SBS only.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:28.370Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:28.370Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbbdc20bd11405a8219f1","name":"Microeconomics for Public Management, Planning & Policy Analysis","location":"60 5th Ave, Rm 110 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Coll of Global Public Health - Grad","units":3,"time":"Th 9:30AM - 12:15PM","course_number":7447,"department":"[object Promise] (Global Public Health)","description":"\n\nOpen to MPH students in GH, PHPM, and SBS only.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:32.082Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:13:32.082Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbbdf20bd11405a8219f2","name":"Microeconomics for Public Management, Planning & Policy Analysis","location":"Bldg:BOBS  Room:LL138 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Coll of Global Public Health - Grad","units":0,"time":"Mo 4:55PM - 5:55PM","course_number":7462,"department":"[object Promise] (Global Public Health)","description":"\n\nOpen to MPH students in GH, PHPM, and SBS only.

We begin by discussing the nature of animal minds. Are animals conscious? Do they experience pain? Do they have beliefs? Do they use language? Are they self-conscious? How can we know? This involves applying concepts from metaphysics and epistemology to research in cognitive ethology and comparative psychology. We then discuss more general questions like: Are animals agents? Do they have free will? Do they live meaningful lives? Do they have moral rights? This involves applying concepts from ethics, existentialism, and other areas of philosophy to our conclusions about animal minds. Finally, we also ask, along the way, how research on animal minds can affect our philosophical theories. For example, should we revise our theories of consciousness, language, agency, morality, and so on if they seem to have implausible implications about animals?","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:21:39.689Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:21:39.689Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbdc720bd11405a821a78","name":"Food, Animals, & The Environment","location":"Bldg:25W4  Room:C-18 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 4:55PM - 7:35PM","course_number":7612,"department":"[object Promise] (Animal Studies)","description":"\n\nThis section restricted to ANST Minors during the 1st week of registration.

Forensic anthropology is an applied subfield of biological anthropology that provides expert analysis of the skeleton in a medico-legal setting by utilizing methods developed in skeletal biology, archaeology, and the forensic sciences.  Forensic anthropologists play critical roles in identifying victims of mass fatalities resulting from both natural and human-made disasters, homicides (both historic and recent), human rights abuses, and war deaths and providing information that may assist in determining the cause of death.  We will examine how forensic anthropologists approach modern and historic crimes in the laboratory and the field.  You will be introduced to the underlying theory and the applied techniques that forensic anthropologists use to recover and identify individuals and assess what happened to the individual before and after death.   At the end of the course, you will have a better appreciation of the theory and practice of forensic anthropology, but you will not have the advanced training required to practice forensic anthropology.

This course satisfies the Non-Western requirement for Art History majors.\n\nIn recent years, the idea of globalization has loomed large in scholarship on both art and history. Self-conscious celebrations or critiques of the nature or rate of global mobility in modernity often obscure, however, the remarkable mobility of artifacts, artists, commodities, gifts, ideas, and techniques in pre-modernity. In the Islamic world, although the pace and scale of such mobility varied, classes of artists, pilgrims, merchants, and soldiers travelled through their engagement in commerce, diplomacy, pilgrimage and even warfare. Through such mobility, architecture, artifacts and ideas about both traveled. This was a world on the move.\n\nIt is, in fact possible, to think of the history of Islamic art as marked by a series of 'global', moments of intensified cultural circulation and interaction. In the seventh and eighth centuries, for example, the caliphate of Damascus ruled over an empire that stretched from Central Asia to Spain, while in the ninth and tenth, the trade networks of a unified Baghdad caliphate extended from Baghdad and Samarra west to north Africa and Spain and east as far as India and China. The conquest of the eastern Islamic world by the Mongols in the thirteenth century marked a rupture, but one that integrated the central Islamic lands into a new and substantial geopolitical entity that included regions from Anatolia to China and Korea. From around 1500, the rise of the 'Gunpowder Empires' - the Ottomans, Safavids and Mughals - created a new world order that interacted closely with the rising imperial and mercantile powers of Europe. These interactions profoundly shaped the modern world.\n\nThis lecture course is intended as a focused survey that introduces some of the key artifacts and monuments that reflect these connections as their focus and intensity shifted from the rise of Islam in the seventh century to the emergence of the modern nation state. Rather than a standard survey course, the lectures present a history that emphasizes the ways in which histories of Islamic art and architecture can provide insights into phenomena of circulation, connectedness and mobility that resonate until today.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:26:35.614Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:26:35.614Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbeef20bd11405a821aca","name":"North American Indian Arts","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:302 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 9:30AM - 12:15PM","course_number":19818,"department":"[object Promise] (Art History)","description":"\n\nARTH-UA 570 Offered periodically. 4 points.\nAn introductory survey of North American Indian and Eskimo art.

Usually it is described as something that is not exactly what it purports to be: a work ascribed falsely to another person.  Forgery also typically carries the stain of malicious intent to deceive, for various reasons, from the playful thrill of trickery to outright plays for political—even world—power.  But did such a concept of deceitful practice exist in antiquity? How has forgery itself changed in concept and practice since then? How have forgeries skewed our understanding of ancient Rome? What might forgeries reveal about the desires of a person, or even a period and its perception of antiquity?  Is modern historical scholarship implicated in the taint of forgery?  This seminar will begin with a broad introduction to the study of forgery in its own right.  We will read selections from the master scholars of forgery, its practice and its effects on history.  We will then delve into the ancient—and especially Roman—practice and concept of forgery, then through the centuries, how forgery has been used to evoke the authority of Roman culture and twist its legitimacy.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:27:25.954Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:27:25.954Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbf2120bd11405a821ad8","name":"Advanced Seminar","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:307 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Mo 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":8118,"department":"[object Promise] (Art History)","description":"\n\nOPEN ONLY TO DEPARTMENTAL MAJORS WHO HAVE COMPLETED FIVE 4-POINT ART HISTORY COURSES. OTHER INTERESTED STUDENTS MUST HAVE A RELEVANT BACKGROUND AND RECEIVE DEPARTMENT CONSENT TO ENROLL.\n\nThis course satisfies the seminar requirement for Art History majors. The thesis of this seminar is that contemporary art in China, Russia, and Eastern Europe continues to be influenced by the experience of Communism in the years 1945-1989.  This was far from uniform.  The bureaucratic ossification of Soviet Communism in the late 1960s and ‘70s coincided chronologically with the upheavals of China’s Cultural Revolution.  Other East Asian nations such as South Korea and Japan avoided Communist rule but experienced comparable phases of authoritarianism and industrial planning.  \nContemporary artists from Russia, Eastern Europe, and East Asia share the artistic legacy of socialist realism, exported from Russia to China in the 1950s.  Seeking earlier artistic sources, Eastern European artists often invoke the Russian avant-garde of the early 20th century, which demonstrates a Slavic origin for modernism.  East Asian artists often allude to earlier traditions such as ink painting and porcelain, which provide signifiers of national identity and of cultural parity with the West.  \nArtists from both regions demonstrate an ambivalent attitude toward capitalism, acknowledging its material benefits but deploring its spiritual poverty.  The ironic melancholy of Eastern European artists evinces a sense of abandonment by the West, whose leaders consented to Stalin’s domination of the region at the Yalta Conference of 1945.  East Asian artists and critics often manifest an antagonism to “neo-liberalism,” which promised democracy but delivered crony capitalism.  “Ostalgia” (a nostalgic longing for life under Communism), which appeared in Eastern European art in the 1990s, has more recently become a significant theme in Chinese art such as Cao Fei’s summer 2019 installation HX (Pompidou Center).  \nThis seminar will be conducted colloquium style, with weekly discussions of shared readings.  Participants will give two brief presentations in class (one on an Eastern European artist, one on an East Asian artist), and will then write a research paper on one artist.  \nAdmission to this class is by permission of the instructor.

OTHER INTERESTED STUDENTS MUST HAVE A RELEVANT BACKGROUND AND RECEIVE DEPARTMENT CONSENT TO ENROLL.\n\nThere has hardly been a more exciting and timely moment to study Bosch and Bruegel, individually and together. Three years ago, Flanders and Spain celebrated the 500th anniversary of the death of Hieronymus Bosch with two exceptionally ambitious shows in the Noordbrabants Museum in his hometown of Den Bosch, Belgium (Hieronymus Bosch – Visions of Genius), and the Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid. Nine years in preparation, the exhibitions showcased the lion’s share of the great fantasist’s paintings (totaling roughly 25, several reunited) and drawings (counting around 20). The accompanying catalogues were further enriched by new findings springing from the Bosch Research and Conservation Project (BRCP). As enigmatic as Bosch the man remains, it is fair to say that we have never known as much about the master’s artistic production as we do today, his technical virtuosity and astonishing flights of imagination now seen in an entirely new and more nuanced light. Meanwhile, last year saw the most comprehensive exhibition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s work hosted by the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Like his predecessor’s pair of traveling exhibitions, the Bruegel show in Vienna was, as its subtitle claimed, indeed a “once in a lifetime” experience, boasting sensational loans and making three-quarters of the master’s extant paintings (29 out of approximately 40) and around half of his surviving drawings and prints available for close study. Meanwhile, the Inside Bruegel project, like the BRCP, revealed a great deal of new information about the painter’s preparatory techniques and paint handling, laying making visible his creative process. Although these ambitious shows are not likely to be repeated in our lifetimes, the present course will endeavor to bring both masters’ lives and careers to life by building on the latest discoveries. We will do so by firmly situating both artists in their own time, attending closely to their sources of inspiration, patrons, and spheres of influence: artistic, religious, and socio-economic, with particular attention to the peasant class on the last count. Taking the recent groundbreaking exhibitions as our point of departure, we will venture widely, examining a broad range of themes that will touch on questions of bodily existence and the afterlife; pilgrimage, actual and spiritual; temptation, sin, and salvation; beauty and ugliness; monstrosity; fantasy and illusion in relation to vernacular life; theater and carnival; artistic processes, with special attention afforded to draftsmanship; humankind’s relationship to Nature; and End Times. Class visits to relevant exhibitions, permanent museum collections, and Print Rooms will be a vital part of the course.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:27:36.504Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:27:36.504Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedbf2b20bd11405a821adb","name":"Independent Studies","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":8120,"department":"[object Promise] (Art History)","description":"\n\nPrerequisite: prior permission of the Director of Undergraduate Studies and of an adviser. 1 to 2 points per term.

In addition, the projected expansion of human population growth is largely predicted to occur in urban areas. Urban Ecology is an interdisciplinary and emerging field of research focused on the consequences of urbanization on ecological processes. In addition to a physically transformed natural landscape, cities are unique from other systems in terms of hydrology, temperature, noise, air quality and many other abiotic factors. In this course we will investigate the consequences of urban constructs on ecological systems. We will discuss factors such as nutrient cycling, organismal behavior and phenology, disease, and the drivers and patterns of biodiversity in urban systems. We will also talk about green spaces, urban planning, and the future of these expanding manmade landscapes. A significant component of this course will involve discussion of current literature. This is an upper-level reasoning course designed primarily for students majoring in biology (ecology track) and environmental studies.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:31:58.352Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:31:58.352Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc03220bd11405a821b23","name":"Cancer Biology","location":"Bldg:BOBS  Room:LL145 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"TuTh 3:30PM - 4:45PM","course_number":23547,"department":"[object Promise] (Biology)","description":"This course covers the fundamental mechanisms of cancer emergence and evolution. Cancer is a devastating disease with huge medical and economical implications. Since the US declared the “War on Cancer” in 1971, the government has spent billions of dollars in research while patients all around the world spend similar sums in medical bills. These investments have led to significant discoveries and therapeutic improvements, but a definitive cure for cancer remains elusive. The course will cover some of the most important advances in cancer research, with a special emphasis on why basic research is critical to address the challenges posed by this disease. Students will gain a solid foundation on the fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms behind tumor initiation, progression, and spreading. Students will also learn how tumors evolve and how this evolutionary process is largely responsible for the difficulties in eradicating cancer. The course finishes with discussion of how basic research has enabled novel therapeutic approaches that are bringing us a step closer to cure cancer.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:32:02.328Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:32:02.328Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc03620bd11405a821b24","name":"Plant Science and Biotechnology","location":"Silver Main, Rm 619 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 11:00AM - 12:15PM","course_number":23548,"department":"[object Promise] (Biology)","description":"Plant biology is relevant to any scientist whose work requires an understanding of food security, climate change, genetic engineering, and drug discovery. This course focuses on the organismal and molecular biology of plants with an emphasis on subjects that have a direct impact on imminent societal challenges. For example, the extension of plant-microbe symbioses is the subject of a multi-million dollar Gates Foundation project to address climate change by lowering energy intensive nitrogen inputs. Other efforts seek the introduction of C4 photosynthesis to new crops in order to stabilize food production in the hot, dry climates that lie ahead. Plant secondary compounds and now plant-based antibody production are important tools in modern medicine. The course does not aim to debate these often-controversial approaches but rather to provide a scientific basis to understand them. The material will incorporate and reinforce concepts in genetics and molecular biology. The course will also emphasize development of rigorous scientific communication skills needed for careers in research and medicine rather than in-class testing.

More novel still is the opportunity to receive instruction in child and adolescent psychopathology from practicing psychiatrists and psychologists at an internationally renowned clinical and research center. Through lecture presentations and discussions, this course focuses on disease etiology, epidemiology, phenomenology, nosology, and diagnosis. It engages students in a critical review of common child and adolescent psychopathology and challenges social and cultural assumptions of what constitutes ?normal? vs. ?pathological? behavior, cognition, and emotion. Students also complete one practicum by participating with a clinician (psychologist or psychiatrist) during the evaluation of a child or adolescent patient at the NYU Child Study Center.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:43:41.833Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:43:41.833Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc2f120bd11405a821bdf","name":"The Treatment of Child & Adolesc Mental Illness","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:411 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"TuTh 12:30PM - 1:45PM","course_number":7592,"department":"[object Promise] (Child/Adoles Mental Hlth Stds)","description":"Provides students with an overview and understanding of the current methods employed in the treatment of child and adolescent mental illness. For most of the past century, treatments for children and adolescents suffering from mental illness relied primarily on open-ended psychotherapies, which have not consistently demonstrated a beneficial effect. Over the past 25 years, however, a variety of new evidence-based treatments have emerged, including behavioral psychotherapies such as cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety and depression, dialectical behavior therapy for personality disorders, and parent management training for children with oppositional and defiant disorders. In addition, we now have strong evidence supporting the use of various pharmacological interventions for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mood and anxiety disorders, and autism. Students investigate each of these treatments by reading and analyzing much of the original research that established their efficacy. This course builds upon Child and Adolescent Psychopathology (V05.0101).","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:43:45.432Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:43:45.432Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc2f420bd11405a821be0","name":"When Nightmare is Real: Trauma in Child &Adolesc","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:405 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Mo 9:30AM - 12:15PM","course_number":7610,"department":"[object Promise] (Child/Adoles Mental Hlth Stds)","description":"Every childhood is fraught with complications, but some children are exposed to traumatic experiences that have a lasting impact on their development and health.

While adolescence is physically the healthiest period of the lifespan, it is also marked by an enormous rise in morbidity and mortality. This seeming paradox can be explained, in part, by biological and psychological changes during puberty that affect emotion regulation, cognition, and consequent risk-taking behavior. At the turn of the twentieth century, adolescence was described as a developmental period inevitably filled with “storm and stress.” In what ways does this vision of adolescence still apply? How should current scientific findings inform our understanding of the propensity for risk-taking behavior during this period (including substance use, increasing sexual activity, and disordered eating)?

The development of this identity is essential to becoming a well-rounded, effective, and high functioning adult, and failure to develop a cohesive sexual identity can lead to dysfunction. Sexual development involves a complex interplay of biological, psychological and sociological components. Sexual differentiation begins in utero, as the fetus is exposed to hormones and growth factors. As children age, their primary and secondary sex organs develop, and their ideas about the function, use and meaning of these organs change. At each stage the environment, social milieu, and hormones, among other factors, influence the direction of these changes. In this course we will explore the impact of sexual identity development on the mental health of children and adolescents.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:45:30.061Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:45:30.061Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc35d20bd11405a821bfd","name":"Looking Back On Growing Up","location":"Bldg:MEYR  Room:121 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"TuTh 2:00PM - 3:15PM","course_number":7603,"department":"[object Promise] (Child/Adoles Mental Hlth Stds)","description":"What is the impact of our upbringing?

We then join current debates on sexual health, psychiatric treatment, end-of-life care and research, and we raise new question about how doctor’s, kids, and families decide.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:46:29.063Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:46:29.063Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc39820bd11405a821c0d","name":"The Art & Science of Parenting","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:401 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Th 12:30PM - 3:15PM","course_number":7605,"department":"[object Promise] (Child/Adoles Mental Hlth Stds)","description":"After spending our early lives with our parents, what can we say about how they influenced our personalities and development? How have our parents affected what we learn, how we act, and how we manage our health? Just as you have wondered about these questions, so have scientists and professionals.

The shoemaker, in attempting to teach the boy this craft, resorts to physical punishment, which was a usual device in Roman education. He hits the boy on the head with a wooden shoe. Unfortunately, the shoemaker/teacher does this with too much force, and so, knocks the boy’s eye out. Thus, the Roman legal experts had to decide what monetary recompense, if any, was due to the father for the damage done to his boy. Here is another example of delict in the Roman world. Person A is carrying a very heavy load, and does not pay attention to the fact that the ground is slippery. He therefore stumbles, and the load he is carrying slips from his grasp, strikes a slave who belongs to person B, and kills the slave. What sum of money, if any, does A now owe to B, since A has now destroyed property (the slave) belonging to B? These are famous sample cases involving the Roman law of delict (tort). \n\nIn this course, we will use a case book, which takes us through the intricacies of how the ancient Roman legal experts constructed this area of their law. The situations they imagine are often quite foreign, even bizarre, to the modern observer. However, the manner in which these Roman experts construct their law is supremely sophisticated, and serves as an extraordinarily good introduction to legal reasoning. This course, then, will offer both a highly interesting glimpse of the ancient Roman social and cultural world, along with a splendid opportunity to cut one’s teeth on some top notch legal reasoning.\nThis will be a two-point course. We will meet once weekly, on Fridays. And please note that a two-point course like this will allow students to use the extra two points of credit per term (n.b.: NYU tuition automatically includes 18 points of course credit per term, not merely 16 points), which generally are left unused.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:48:15.044Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:48:15.044Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc40220bd11405a821c2a","name":"Honors Seminar","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":7849,"department":"[object Promise] (Classics)","description":"null","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:48:18.456Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:48:18.456Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc40620bd11405a821c2b","name":"Greek Painting: From Myth to Image","location":"Bldg:194M  Room:205 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 11:00AM - 12:15PM","course_number":18928,"department":"[object Promise] (Classics)","description":"null","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:48:22.316Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:48:22.316Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc40920bd11405a821c2c","name":"Classical Mythology","location":"Bldg:19UP  Room:102 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"TuTh 11:00AM - 12:15PM","course_number":7850,"department":"[object Promise] (Classics)","description":"\n\nThis course is an examination of the meaning, form and function of Greek and Roman mythology especially its transmission via the literature, art and material culture of the ancient Mediterranean world. We explore the way in which these stories operated in Greek and Roman culture and seek to understand what they were articulating in contemporary social, political, military, economic and artistic life. Consequently, a number of ancient texts will be read in translation and set against iconographic evidence from vase paintings, sculpture and architecture. The course begins by surveying the various ways in which mythology has been catalogued and studied from the ancient mythographers to Freud, Propp. Levi-Strauss, and Burkert  Then ancient texts are used to explore how myth developed throughout the classical period. These will include Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, Hesiod’s Work and Days and Theogony, the Homeric hymns to the gods, Greek tragedy and comedy, Virgil’s Aeneid and Ovid’s Metamorphoses. The influence of mythology on the works of Chaucer, Shakespeare and in film will also be discussed. The class meets twice a week and students are expected to complete bi-weekly readings, contribute to in class discussions and a class Blackboard discussion board, sit a mid term and a final complete one essay and attend at least one related theatre performance.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:48:25.978Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:48:25.978Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc40d20bd11405a821c2d","name":"Topics in Religious Studies","location":"45 West 4th St, Rm B06 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 9:30AM - 10:45AM","course_number":23376,"department":"[object Promise] (Classics)","description":"null","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:48:29.468Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:48:29.468Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc41120bd11405a821c2e","name":"The Greek Thinkers","location":"Silver Main, Rm 503A Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 11:00AM - 12:15PM","course_number":24008,"department":"[object Promise] (Classics)","description":"The origins of nonmythical speculation among the Greeks and the main patterns of philosophical thought, from Thales and other early speculators about the physical nature of the world through Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, the Epicureans, and the Neoplatonists.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T03:48:33.120Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T03:48:33.120Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc41420bd11405a821c2f","name":"Advanced Latin: Comedy","location":"Silver Main, Rm 503 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 9:30AM - 10:45AM","course_number":20587,"department":"[object Promise] (Classics)","description":"A selection of plays from those of Plautus and Terence.

How can their stories along with the work of artists, scholars and activists challenge dominant narratives and unravel the myths that help to give borders and related terms—refuge, asylum, immigrant, citizen--their meaning and even their power? “Fictions” in the title of the course also refers to one of the primary means (the reading of novels, plays, poetry, short fiction) by which we will explore alternatives to the limited realities that borders attempt to produce.

Taken as both an open and valueless category, as well as one that is already determined by networks of discursive and institutional power, everyday life seems to harbor within it the possibility of new forms of perceiving and feeling. If traditional understandings of culture privilege the spirituality of abstract reason, then contemporary theories of everyday life commonly emphasize the materiality of lived experience. As grand narratives of history become increasingly suspicious in our cultural thinking, everyday life may appear to provide a vantage point to re-examine the nature of human existence.  The goal of this class will be to bring theoretical perspectives on everyday life to the study of modern and contemporary Chinese culture. In a society that has undergone such dramatic and rapid transformations, we will aim to begin our critical inquiry on the level of the quotidian. While the field of Chinese cultural production has often been explicitly dominated by broad questions of history, politics, and the nation, we will not ignore these sorts of larger issues; rather, we will approach them by examining the contested arena of everyday life as it is registered in modern Chinese literature and film. Although the course will be divided into three units—everyday life and the city; personal reflection and nostalgia; and boredom and ennui—these categories are by no means mutually exclusive and will prove to be overlapping in a number of ways. Course materials will include a number of theoretical readings spread out through the semester, which are meant to broadly complement our overall examination of literature and film.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:08:49.335Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:08:49.335Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc8d520bd11405a821d79","name":"Topics:","location":"Bldg:GCASL  Room:384 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Mo 9:30AM - 12:15PM","course_number":19077,"department":"[object Promise] (Comparative Literature)","description":"\n\nAlthough literature by Middle Easterners, particularly Arab-Americans, in English is not\na new phenomenon, it has flourished in the past two decades.

Drawing on\npostcolonial theory, this course will pose, among others, the following questions: How do the writers we study identify--Arab, Arab-American, Anglo-Egyptian, British, American, Middle Eastern--and what is at stake in such labels? How do we parse the abiding legacy of colonialism, in particular Orientalism, in stereotypes about Middle Eastern émigrés? What risks of complicity might come with identities hyphenated across sides divided by imperialism and neo-colonialism? What translational strategies are adopted in the texts to be read and can we speak of such a thing as “Arabglish”?

At the center of the poem is the human being, his condition in the after life and his punishment or reward. Taken literally, the theme is the state of the souls after the death. But allegorically, the true subject is moral life and thus the torments of the sins themselves or the enjoyment of a happy and saintly life. Since the beginning of its circulation the Divine Comedy has been seen as a text to be read in context, that is in light of the cultural tradition Dante was channelling and interpreting.  This course proposes a reading of Dante’s Commedia, considered in light of the ancient and  medieval idea of learning. The objective of the course is to familiarize students with one of the most important author of Western culture.

Ever since, cultural producers and critics have been trying to answer this question. The first decade or so of the Soviet state was probably the most prolific ground for Marxist art and art theory, until socialist realism became “the basic method of all Soviet art and criticism” in the early 1930s. In the ensuing decades of the twentieth century, leftist thinkers and artists from the West and subsequently, from the Third World, challenged Soviet hegemony on Marxism. The end of the Soviet bloc represented a blow to the left everywhere, especially in Russia, but even there, Marxism, with its attendant aesthetics, still exists. Shifting in and out of Russia, this course will populate this 150-year-long historical trajectory with such canonical texts, authors, and movements as Marx and Engels, Plekhanov, Gorky, Trotsky, the Soviet avant-garde of the 1920s, the socialist realism of the 1930s, Gramsci and Adorno, Mao and Latin American Third Cinema, and as well as such contemporary Russian leftist artists as the Chto Delat’ collective, Kirill Medvedev, Roman Osminkin, and Victoria Lomasko.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:09:15.257Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:09:15.257Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc8ee20bd11405a821d80","name":"Topics:","location":"Bldg:TISC  Room:LC3 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"TuTh 9:30AM - 10:45AM","course_number":23323,"department":"[object Promise] (Comparative Literature)","description":"\n\nthis course in English will examine several French and Francophone plays that deal with the fraught question of immigration to France.

From the Eastern European Jewish women who worked in sweatshops and had to deal with the results of the Holocaust in France, to the Central Asian refugees attempting to get to Western Europe but ending up in holding camps, to the African boys who froze to death on the landing gear of an airplane headed to Paris, contemporary stories have given rise to theatrical expressions that stage, in often innovative ways, one of the world’s most urgent problems:  which people have the right to seek help and asylum in countries other than where they were born?","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:09:18.890Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:09:18.890Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc8f220bd11405a821d81","name":"Independent Study","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":7857,"department":"[object Promise] (Comparative Literature)","description":"\n\nPERMISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRED.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:09:22.492Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:09:22.492Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc8f620bd11405a821d82","name":"Independent Study:","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":2,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":7858,"department":"[object Promise] (Comparative Literature)","description":"\n\nPERMISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRED.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:09:26.210Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:09:26.210Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedc8fa20bd11405a821d83","name":"Introduction to Computer Programming (No Prior Experience)","location":"Bldg:CIWW  Room:201 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 3:30PM - 4:45PM","course_number":7667,"department":"[object Promise] (Computer Science)","description":"Prerequisite: Three years of high school mathematics or equivalent.

This is called sequential programming. We feel very comfortable with this because we think in a sequential way and give the machine statements to be executed in sequence. However, this has to change. A microprocessor with single core no longer exists in almost all computers we are using today (including your tablets and smart phones). Most of our devices are now multicore processors. A multicore processor contains several cores (called CPUs or cores) on-chip. To make the best use of these multicore chips we need to program them in-parallel. Sequential programming, for all platforms from smartphones to supercomputers, is falling out of fashion and taking back-seat to parallel programming. How to think in parallel? How to write code in parallel to make the best use of the underlying hardware? How is that new hardware different from the traditional one? What will the future be for the software and hardware?

Typical applications include: information extraction (automatically finding information from text); information retrieval (web searches and other applications involving the automatic selection of \"relevant\" documents); sentiment analysis (automatic extraction of opinions about a set of issues); and machine translation (automatically translating one natural language to another). Much of the best work in the field combines two methodologies: (1) automatically acquiring statistical information from one set of \"training\" documents to use as the basis for probabilistically predicting the distribution of similar information in new documents; and (2) using manually encoded linguistic knowledge. For example, many supervised methods of machine learning require: a corpus of text with manually encoded linguistic knowledge, a set of procedures for acquiring statistical patterns from this data and a transducer for predicting these same distinctions in new text. This class will cover linguistic, statistical and computational aspects of this exciting field.\n\nRegistration is open to CAS, Gallatin, Liberal Studies, Abu Dhabi and Shanghai students on Monday, November 11, 2019.

By exploring Giovanni Paisiello’s The Barber of Seville (1782), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro (1786), and Gioachino Rossini’s own version of The Barber of Seville (1816) – which opened in Saint Petersburg, Vienna, and Rome, respectively – we will look at the ways in which Italian opera across Europe staged conflicts of class and gender, challenging the assumptions of the aristocracy as well as the ludicrous pretensions of the rising bourgeoisie. The same themes inform the post-modern portrayal of the past in John Corigliano’s The Ghosts of Versailles (1991), which completes the musical afterlife of the Figaro trilogy, providing us with retrospective insight into the working of reception and adaptation.

By focusing on both the material conditions of performance as well as the performative practices of living, working, and studying in New York, students will attempt to understand the complex and exciting imbrications of art and society, of theater and civic life. NOTE: In order to take this course, students must be available to see performances every Thursday evening (in addition to regularly scheduled class meetings).","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:19:26.111Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:19:26.111Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedcb5120bd11405a821e26","name":"Topics in Performance Studies","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Th 11:00AM - 1:45PM","course_number":20843,"department":"[object Promise] (Dramatic Literature)","description":"\n\n**To be held in the Rehearsal Room of the Skirball Center.**\nDRLIT-UA 301.001 | Curating Experimental Performance | Prof. Woolf & Prof. Jay Wegman | T 11:00-12:15\n\nDebates and dialogues are raging around the “curatorial turn” in theatre and performance. As a result, the performance curator has emerged as a pivotal figure who works to navigate and re-articulate this evolving interdisciplinary arts environment at both the artistic and institutional levels. How might the curator help us to imagine alternative organizational structures in the arts and beyond based on camaraderie, empathy, and love? Or on uncertainty, ephemerality, and chaos? In this course, we will examine performance curation through the curator’s role as researcher, interpreter, commissioner, collaborator, and producer. We will take on a range of theories and performance practices, and invite special guests – curators, artistic directors, theatre makers – to help us think in different ways about the relations between theatre/performance and the institutions that support them. Topics addressed will include: histories of experimental performance, contemporary aesthetics, festivals, new forms of arts organization, and hands-on practical engagement with the nitty-gritty realities of curatorial practice.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:19:29.757Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:19:29.757Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedcb5520bd11405a821e27","name":"Topics in Performance Studies","location":"Room: TBA Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Th 9:30AM - 12:15PM","course_number":9748,"department":"[object Promise] (Dramatic Literature)","description":"\n\nDRLIT-UA 301.002 | Queer Politics & Performance | Prof. Carr | T 9:30am–12:15pm\n\nThis course takes sexuality as its lens through which to consider performance, and vice versa.

It follows two strands: one historical and the other more theoretical. Specific instances of the role of gender in theatrical modes of production will be studied in the examples of Classical Greek and Elizabethan Tragedy. The absence of women from these stages will be read in relation to both the particular historical contexts and to the types of conventions of representation this absence helped shape. This historical investigation will continue into the age of Modernity where the ‘woman question’ becomes central to the modes and tropes of Naturalist theatre. A parallel concern of the course will be the structural link between gender construction and performativity as this has been expressed by recent psychoanalytical and gender theory. In this context recent developments in Queer Theory will be discussed with examples from contemporary plays and Performance Art.\n\nFor more information, see the Dramatic Literature website: as.nyu.edu/english/dramatic-literature","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:20:02.351Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:20:02.351Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedcb7620bd11405a821e30","name":"Internship","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":2,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":7862,"department":"[object Promise] (Dramatic Literature)","description":"\n\nThis course requires departmental consent.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:20:06.239Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:20:06.239Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedcb7920bd11405a821e31","name":"Independent Study","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":2,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":7863,"department":"[object Promise] (Dramatic Literature)","description":"\n\nThis course requires departmental consent.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:20:09.964Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:20:09.964Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedcb7d20bd11405a821e32","name":"Elementary Chinese I","location":"Bldg: 7E12  Rm: 127 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoTuWeTh 8:00AM - 9:15AM","course_number":7944,"department":"[object Promise] (East Asian Studies)","description":"Designed to develop and reinforce language skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing as it relates to everyday life situations.

As the world’s territory was divided between the colonizers and colonized during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Japan’s case was unusual. The country started out as a victim of imperialism in the nineteenth century, but became an aggressor in the twentieth, ruling over other Asian people. We will situate the Japanese empire vis-à-vis the rest of Asia and pay particular attention to the circulation of goods, ideas, people and practices across imperial boundaries, which shaped both the empire and the countries that surrounded it.

Readings of literary texts in combination with critical essays help students to examine this paradox in relation to changes in the practice of reading, the construction of the ?reader? and the ?author,? the practice and effects of translation and travel, the privileging of the spoken voice, and the solidification of the ?novel? as a genre. Students pay as much attention to formal questions such as point of view and narrative strategy as to ?content? and are ever wary of the fact that they are reading in translation.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:25:02.010Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:25:02.010Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedcca220bd11405a821e82","name":"Readings in Chinese Philosophy and Culture","location":"Bldg:GCASL  Room:275 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 2:00PM - 3:15PM","course_number":9547,"department":"[object Promise] (East Asian Studies)","description":"\n\nCoverage from the era of Confucius (d. 479 B.C.E.) to the unification of the realm in 206 B.C.E., the pre-imperial period that is also known as the warring states.

In the same spirit as Dickinson, Wallace Stevens wrote that “Things as they are / Are changed upon my blue guitar:” in doing so he pointed to the particular quality of literature that it tells us how things really are while at the same time creating them, making them all up. Reading a novel feels as if we are entering a real world, in which the novelist can take us to anywhere, amongst any people on earth. But a novel is by definition fiction, not real. How does literature manage to combine these qualities of the real and the unreal at the same time? How does literature succeed in generating such powerful emotions in us, such intensity of feelings, when we know at the back of our minds that we are reading a work of pure imagination? What are the particular qualities of literary language—evident, for example, in the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas’ phrase “a grief ago,” which disobeys the rules of grammar and yet conjures up a powerful evocation of the emotion of grief by transforming it into a form of time, so that it speaks to us personally and discovers for us something about ourselves and our own memories and identities. These are the questions that will drive our enquiries into the experience and form of literature, as we seek to understand how it catches us captures us and intrigues us. How can we come to recognize, experience and evoke its uncanny power?  We will consider examples of poetry, drama, fiction and autobiography from many different literatures of the world, comparing creative writings from different cultures while also thinking about what happens when we translate literary texts from one language to another, just as when we read a literary text we translate the black marks on a page into scenes somehow staged and taking place in our own minds. We will be dwelling in possibilities.

The course explores the ascendance of globalization as US culture is both transmitted around the world and is increasingly diversified within by the growth of ethnic literatures and their institutional study. Our emphasis is on the changing scope of English-language literature and culture since 1900. The course explores a variety of forms including literature, poetry, drama, film, and graphic fiction. We will read texts as responses to the rapidity of cultural change under the pressure of urbanization, patterns of transnational migration, hemispheric diasporic movements, visual media, and turbulence in gender roles and national identities. It will explore relationships between globalization theory, literary form, and cultural themes.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:35:49.165Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:35:49.165Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedcf2820bd11405a821f2f","name":"Literatures in English IV: Twentieth and Twenty-first Century Literatures","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:402 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":0,"time":"Th 4:55PM - 6:10PM","course_number":10076,"department":"[object Promise] (English)","description":"An overview of English-language literary production as it expands and diversifies from 1900 onward.

Drawing on the rich theatrical resources of New York City, students see approximately 14 performances from across the boroughs, covering Broadway to Off-Off, traditional to experimental theater. Readings include plays and essays in theory and criticism. By focusing on both the material conditions of performance as well as the performative practices of living, working, and studying in New York, students will attempt to understand the complex and exciting imbrications of art and society, of theater and civic life. NOTE: In order to take this course, students must be available to see performances every Thursday evening (in addition to regularly scheduled class meetings).","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:36:11.092Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:36:11.092Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedcf3e20bd11405a821f35","name":"Reading as a Writer","location":"Bldg:194M  Room:204 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Mo 2:00PM - 4:45PM","course_number":9354,"department":"[object Promise] (English)","description":"\n\nENGL-UA 201.001 | Reading as a Writer: Forms of Attention | Prof. Hyland\n\nOne of the most common questions asked of writers is: where do your ideas come from? This course begins from the premise that almost all writing has its origins in close attention to the world, often as mediated by existing texts, images, and/or sounds. Good writing is the product of intense and intelligent noticing: of structures, textures, syntaxes (both verbal and nonverbal), temperaments and temperatures. Over the course of this semester, we will look at how writers pay attention: to sound, speech and music; to existing literary and legal texts; to visual art and the nuances of place. We will posit reading, listening, looking, feeling (as with one’s hands and/or body), and researching—among other gerunds—as activities, and explore these activities as sources of writing, as resources for interpretation, and as ways of making knowledge. Our analysis will sometimes focus on the structural level, and sometimes on the intimate and close-up. In this seminar, we will practice both critical and creative forms of attention. We’ll look into and practice forms of writing that listen closely, that gaze with attention, that interrogate sources and histories. The bulk of our readings will come from the genres of poetry and creative nonfiction, with occasional readings of literary and cultural theory, fiction, and performance texts. Over the course of the semester, students will produce weekly short critical and/or creative responses to class readings, as well as a longer hybrid creative-critical response text. Writers to be considered include Michael Ondaatje, M. NourbeSe Philip, Vi Khi Nao, Allison Cobb, William Wordsworth, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Layli Long Soldier, Hanif Abdurraqib, Kaia Sand, and others.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:36:14.713Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:36:14.713Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedcf4220bd11405a821f36","name":"Reading as a Writer","location":"Bldg:194M  Room:204 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":9761,"department":"[object Promise] (English)","description":"\n\nENGL-UA 201.001 | Reading as a Writer | Prof. Noel\n\nThis course is neither a creative-writing workshop nor a seminar devoted to literary analysis.

While we will study conventional and not-so-conventional poetic and narrative forms (from sonnets to erasure poetry and microfiction), we will seek to understand the texts at hand from a position of creative and critical engagement: what are the stakes (e.g. formal, political) of a given text and what can we learn from these texts that can inform our own writing? How can we understand the work of creative writers as critical interventions, and how can we read critical texts as creative writers, seeking out our own literary and expressive coordinates? How does social engagement figure into the question? We will hear from socially engaged creative writers (including Latinx writers) whose work is informed by critical methods and perspectives, and we will explore modes of writing at the intersection of the creative and the critical.

At the center of the poem is the human being, his condition in the after life and his punishment or reward. Taken literally, the theme is the state of the souls after the death. But allegorically, the true subject is moral life and thus the torments of the sins themselves or the enjoyment of a happy and saintly life. Since the beginning of its circulation the Divine Comedy has been seen as a text to be read in context, that is in light of the cultural tradition Dante was channelling and interpreting.  This course proposes a reading of Dante’s Commedia, considered in light of the ancient and  medieval idea of learning. The objective of the course is to familiarize students with one of the most important author of Western culture.

In this course, we will read a variety of coming-of-age stories (including slave narratives, realist fiction, and modernist novels), looking at their distinctive vocabulary and narrative practices while placing them in dialogue with each other. We will explore the affordances and limits of the novel, taking up how various authors have attempted to reckon with the existential uncertainty of living in a global system, in which important factors influencing peoples’ lives are out-of-sight and difficult to imagine or comprehend. Finally, we will look at how postcolonial fiction rewrites a tradition that seems to valorize an individual shedding his or her bonds to a childhood community and which frequently figures the passage from adolescence to adulthood as the journey of a young person from a culturally backward rural province to a political and economic capital.

In line with such an inquiry, the course will consider more recent queer adaptations of Shakespeare, from Oscar Wilde’s Portrait of Mr. W.H., to films like Derek Jarman’s The Tempest or Gus Van Sant’s My Own Private Idaho, challenging us to grapple with the ways these seventeenth-century texts continue to inspire new horizons of possibility for queer expression.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:36:55.452Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:36:55.452Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedcf6b20bd11405a821f41","name":"Colloquium:","location":"Ireland House, Rm 102 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"TuTh 2:00PM - 3:15PM","course_number":9577,"department":"[object Promise] (English)","description":"\n\nJames Joyce’s encyclopedic 1922 novel Ulysses is considered by many to be the greatest literary achievement of the twentieth century.

Postcolonial literary and cinematic texts have engaged the colonial past both through representation of such resistance, as well as attempts to understand and analyze the meaning of their instances, their impact, and their historical gains and losses. In this course we will read/watch some of the key texts of anti-colonial resistance. Some of these were written by the leaders of liberation movements like Gandhi and Fanon, or offer accounts of them (like C.L.R. James’s famous Black Jacobins about the Haitian revolution), offering us insights into the rationale, the strategies, the ethics and  politics, and the limits and possibilities of anti-colonial struggles on the ground. Some books were consciously envisaged as ‘writing back’ to empire, challenging ‘colonial’ texts like Shakespeare’s Tempest, Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, and Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. In many postcolonial literary texts the colonizer’s language—English, or French-- is resisted, deplored and despaired of as a colonial legacy, even as it cannot be entirely rejected. Several texts show the tragic consequences for colonial subjects suffering from profound cultural dislocation and trauma. Others—consequently—urge the necessity of ‘decolonizing the mind.’ We will consider a variety of texts reflecting the many aspects of ‘resistance’, broadly understood: novels by Tayib Salih, Rabindranath Tagore, Tsistsi Dangarembga, plays by C.L. R. James and Aime Cesaire, poems by Neruda, Faiz, Cesaire, Darwish, Nourbese Philip, John Agard, essays by Edward Said, Jamaica Kincaid, Ngugi wa Thiongo and Chinua Achebe, and films by Gillo Pontecorvo (Battle of Algiers), Satyajit Ray (Home and the World, The Chess Players), and Neill Blomkamp  (District 9).","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:37:32.491Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:37:32.491Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedcf9020bd11405a821f4b","name":"Topics:","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:504 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 9:30AM - 10:45AM","course_number":9600,"department":"[object Promise] (English)","description":"\n\nENGL-UA 800.002 | Asian American Literary and Cultural Studies | Prof. Sudhinaraset\nThis course will explore the proliferation of Asian American cultural production to study the relationship between Asian American aesthetics, politics, forms, and identities.

In each type of literature, the protagonist typically leaves home, visits a strange place, observes marvelous phenomena, and comes home to tell of his or her experience. The main focus of the course is early medieval English literature, but we will also take a comparative approach by reading related texts from antiquity (e.g. Vergil, Cicero), medieval Ireland (imram or ‘fabulous voyage’ genre), medieval Scandinavia (zombie sagas), the Continent (Dante et al.), and post-Conquest Britain (e.g. Pearl, Sir John Mandeville).  Today, visions and travel narratives are designated as two separate genres, but the close connection between the two was apparently understood by classical and medieval authors, for visions and travels often appear side by side in their wok (e.g. Scipio’s Dream, Divine Comedy); in some genres, the coupling of the two has even become a convention (e.g. epic/heroic poetry and, to a certain degree, hagiography). The goal of this course is for us to build, collectively, a new approach to medieval literature, while, individually, developing exciting ideas for our respective research projects.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:38:16.477Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:38:16.477Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedcfbc20bd11405a821f57","name":"Senior Seminar: 18th-Century British Literature","location":"244 Greene St, Rm 105 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 9:30AM - 10:45AM","course_number":10274,"department":"[object Promise] (English)","description":"\n\nENGL-UA 953 | #MeToo 1.0: 18TH-CENTURY BRITISH WOMEN WRITERS | Prof. McDowell\n\n\"If all men are born free, how is it that all Women are born slaves?\" So demanded Mary Astell in Some Reflections Upon Marriage (Preface, 1706), her treatise responding to Enlightenment philosopher John Locke. In seizing the new media form of their time -- print -- to challenge institutionalized inequities and forge gender-based solidarities across divisions of geography and social rank, eighteenth-century women writers anticipated our own moment in saying \"MeToo\" to one another and to those in power. At no time in the past three hundred years has there been easier access to early women's writing (now available via anthologies, scholarly editions, classroom paperbacks, and digital collections). Yet even today, many English majors graduate unaware of the extent and diversity of these women's poems, plays, fiction, essays, satire, conduct books, letters, periodicals, and other works. We will examine the media forms, genres, and literary and rhetorical conventions and strategies of Restoration and eighteenth-century authors such as Margaret Cavendish, Dorothy Osborne, Aphra Behn, Elinor James, Mary Astell, Delarivier Manley, Mary Wortley Montagu, Francis Burney, Phyllis Wheatley, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Jane Austen. We will supplement these readings with selections from male authors such as Locke, Samuel Richardson, and Henry Fielding. Addressing issues such as courtship and marriage, literacy and education, spirituality, sexuality, and female agency (economic, political, legal) and its lack, these women held different -- sometimes competing -- views. (As Astell observed in 1706, \"Women are not so well united as to form an Insurrection.\") Yet if we believe in the Enlightenment notion of \"progress\" (Astell did not), why is it that in our \"electronic age\" of near-instant global communication, we might well make the same observation today?","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:38:20.117Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:38:20.117Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedcfbf20bd11405a821f58","name":"Senior Seminar: 19th-Century British Literature","location":"Bldg:BOBS  Room:837 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 2:00PM - 4:45PM","course_number":10276,"department":"[object Promise] (English)","description":"\n\nENGL-UA 954 | The Brontës | Prof. Regaignon\n\nImmediately popular and controversial, the novels of Anne, Emily, and Charlotte Brontë invite inquiries into the transformations of the novel form in the 1840s.

Du Bois, \"The Children of the Moon,\" Darkwater: Voices from Within the Veil (1920)  | While most of us have read at least part of Du Bois's opus, The Souls of Black Folk (1903), his subsequent works are too often ignored, even as they demonstrate that he continued to develop his understandings of race and social justice over time. Above all a writer, Du Bois lived until 1963, having moved to Ghana and renouncing his American citizenship in his final years, and he responded to the major (and many minor) political and cultural conflicts of the era in his powerful and singular voice. In the allegorical poem above, for instance, Du Bois imagines a Christ-like figure recalling his \"dread\" acts of emancipation from beyond the grave, and yet as the second line suggests, the time for a full recounting has not quite arrived. This course believes that the time has come, and indeed, demands a new understanding of the period in which Du Bois lived and wrote. We begin with Du Bois's early sociological writing and will continue through proto-modernism, the Harlem Renaissance and its aftermaths, returning to Du Bois — including his science fiction, speeches, poetry, and his incendiary political writing — at regular intervals.

Urban Ecology is an interdisciplinary and emerging field of research focused on the consequences of urbanization on ecological processes. In addition to a physically transformed natural landscape, cities are unique from other systems in terms of hydrology, temperature, noise, air quality and many other abiotic factors. In this course we will investigate the consequences of urban constructs on ecological systems. We will discuss factors such as nutrient cycling, organismal behavior and phenology, disease, and the drivers and patterns of biodiversity in urban systems. We will also talk about green spaces, urban planning, and the future of these expanding manmade landscapes. A significant component of this course will involve discussion of current literature.

It can put an issue on the political agenda, it often guides and underpins rationales for policy, while enabling us to monitor implementation. In short, science can provide a reason for humankind to act on environmental problems, while policy enables us to do so. Therefore, understanding how science translates into policy – from a theoretical, historical and practical perspective – is critical to understanding environmental governance. This course explores how the scientific process, as well as scientists themselves, influence environmental policy – from agenda setting, to legislation and implementation. In order to ground the discussion, the course will focus on specific issues including, but not necessarily limited to: stratospheric ozone depletion, climate change, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), pesticides, whaling and nutrient pollution.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:40:14.558Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:40:14.558Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd03120bd11405a821f77","name":"History of American Environmental Policy","location":"Bldg:TISC  Room:LC3 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 6:20PM - 8:50PM","course_number":19615,"department":"[object Promise] (Environmental Studies)","description":"\n\nRestricted to ENVST majors and minors during the first week of registration.

We begin with a survey of these theoretical approaches, so that students can be conversant in the basic theory and vocabulary of activism. We then examine the growing role of activism in local and global politics amidst the broader trend of globalization.

Frequently associated with the phenomenon of “Post materialist value change”, these parties have transformed European party systems and the policies of established democracies.\n\nThis class introduces Green parties in their programmatic approach to politics and asks why they were successful in some countries but not in others. Furthermore, we will trace their origins to the social movements of the 1960s and ask to what extent these parties are the heirs of the changes these movements have brought about. We will also discuss the idea of a “silent counter revolution” that explains the emergence of right wing populist parties as a reaction to the changes Green parties embody.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:41:51.652Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:41:51.652Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd09320bd11405a821f92","name":"Topics:","location":"King Juan Carlos, Rm 324 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Th 10:00AM - 12:00PM","course_number":8092,"department":"[object Promise] (European and Mediterranean Stu)","description":"\n\nIn the past decade the countries of Europe, and the European Union as an organization, have been facing multiple challenges. The 2008 financial crisis hit several countries and generated a crisis in the shared Eurozone; Euroscepticism has given rise to populist movements throughout the continent; waves of migration were met with struggle and backlash; Western European countries have been threatened by terror; Russia is increasingly aggressive; and recently the US is increasingly indifferent and even hostile toward its European allies. In this course we will attempt to evaluate the following questions: Do these challenges amount to a crisis? Is the integrity of the EU in danger? What can be done to face these multiple challenges? The course explores the dimensions of the European crisis: sovereignty, democracy, economy, security, and culture. We will explore these questions in the EU, in its relationships, and in key individual cases such as Britain, Germany, Greece, Poland, and Hungary.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:41:55.297Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:41:55.297Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd09620bd11405a821f93","name":"Topics:","location":"King Juan Carlos, Rm 701 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Th 2:00PM - 4:45PM","course_number":22849,"department":"[object Promise] (European and Mediterranean Stu)","description":"\n\nSame as HIST-UA 670 The Art of War: History, Theory, Law, Representation","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:41:58.985Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:41:58.985Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd09a20bd11405a821f94","name":"Independent Study","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":8093,"department":"[object Promise] (European and Mediterranean Stu)","description":"Prerequisite: permission of the department.

New technologies have blurred the boundary between home and work. New economic opportunities and pressures have sent women into the workplace. The rise of the “new economy” has created jobs with more short-term flexibility, but less long-term security. And new options in intimate relationships have created more diverse and voluntary, but less predictable family ties. These intertwined shifts signal a social transformation that is reshaping the daily lives and life pathways of 21st century women and men. To explore the twin revolutions in work and care, the class will address several questions: What does an overview of changes in work, family, and gender patterns tell us about where we are now and where we are going? What are the major dilemmas and dislocations created by these changes, and how are people coping with these conflicts? What are the implications for the future? And what can we do to enhance the opportunities and limit the insecurities and inequalities of these new arrangements for women, men, and children?","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:54:32.964Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:54:32.964Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd38c20bd11405a822060","name":"Xenophon of Athens-Cavalry Commander and Socratic Philosopher","location":"Bldg:194M  Room:303 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 9:30AM - 12:15PM","course_number":19625,"department":"[object Promise] (First-Year Seminars)","description":"The greatest ancient you’ve never heard of, Xenophon of Athens (c. 425–355 B.C.E.) was a brilliant general, student of Socrates, and renowned author.

As it became a world power at the end of the 19th century, the US began to deploy its wealth and force abroad to advance its national interests, as other great powers did—but also, or so it said and so its people deeply believed, to shape a more peaceful, democratic, and just world order. The United States continued to pursue that self-assigned mission through two world wars and the Cold War, and now in the face of terrorism. America is unlike any previous world power both in the beliefs on which it was founded and in its geographical situation, surrounded by oceans and far removed from the conflicts in which it intervenes. And yet it is also a hegemon—a dominant power—and shapes the world to its perceived interests, as all hegemons do. Over the last century, critics have never stopped accusing the US of hypocritically pursuing narrow interests in the name of global good. In electing a new president, American voters may finally have put that claim to rest by choosing someone who does not accept the nation's historic mission. This class will examine a series of critical points—war, colonialism, the founding of global institutions, interventions abroad—in order to understand the tension between America's idealistic global mission and the brute fact of its power and dominance.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:54:44.134Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:54:44.134Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd39720bd11405a822063","name":"Gestures, Movement, and Literature","location":"Bldg:GCASL  Room:274 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 11:00AM - 1:30PM","course_number":19688,"department":"[object Promise] (First-Year Seminars)","description":"Working in the space of articulation between dance, literature, and politics, this seminar examines movement(s) and dance as a key element with which to read transformative moments of history, culture, politics, and philosophy.

We will review the interactions of climate and environment with the evolution of our species, and explore the effects of the ice ages on human societies and cultures, and on our dispersal across the globe as the ultimate invasive species. We will discover the effects of climate change on societies as diverse as the ancient Middle East, the pre-Columbian Maya, and the Norse settlers of Iceland and Greenland. We will also see how past peoples did not simply react to environmental change, but often induced it, from the earliest domestications of animals and plants, to the manipulation of entire landscapes by Europeans, Native Americans, and Aboriginal Australians.

As people continue to move across borders, the relationship between identity and place has been reimagined, offering new possibilities for connection. Yet, this has also sparked political anxieties about belonging and citizenship for both individuals and nations, rendering some immigrants as perpetually outside the “imagined community” of the nation, effectively living on the borderlands of belonging. How do those on the borders navigate belonging, citizenship, and identity in the Americas? What are the implications of these struggles for understandings of nations and selves? This seminar explores the lived experience of those moving across national borders as they negotiate various borderlands in their search for home. We turn to testimonial accounts and ethnographies to explore life on the borderlands, also drawing on key conceptual frameworks in migration and diaspora studies related to borders and identity.

But as the 2007-2010 mortgage crisis dramatically highlighted, dreams of “the good life” in late capitalist societies can unexpectedly turn into nightmares. This course investigates the fantasies, disappointments, and psychopathologies—both everyday and aberrant—that have accompanied twentieth and twenty-first century experiences of dwelling. We examine a series of existing, or formerly existing, architectural spaces (from large scale housing projects to O.J. Simpson’s Brentwood estate and Donald Trump’s Fifth Avenue penthouse) alongside an array of artworks and narratives from literature and film that center on built environments. We also look at how the fundamental human activity of dwelling has been thought about by philosophers, critics, psychoanalysts, urban geographers, and political theorists. Students’ research will explore how the problems associated with dwelling intersect with issues such as economic inequality, racial and sexual marginalization, creative and emotional growth or arrestation, and the everyday strategies involved in coping with large-scale social and political upheaval. Of particular concern to us will be the ways in which the private spaces people inhabit—even, or especially, when they are designed to embody their most sought-after dreams—fail to provide the sense of comfort and security associated, in the popular imagination, with \"home.\"","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:55:09.845Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:55:09.845Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd3b120bd11405a82206a","name":"Spectacle of Cruelty: A Theatrical Investigation","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:402 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 2:00PM - 4:30PM","course_number":10134,"department":"[object Promise] (First-Year Seminars)","description":"This course takes as its hypothesis that cruelty, at least in its political forms, is a form of spectacle: a performance designed to horrify or dazzle an intended audience. Perhaps for this reason, some of our most potent theatrical writers, from Euripides to Suzan-Lori Parks, have performed cruelty for us, shown us its face, explored its dimensions, invited us to live in its world. We will use theatrical texts to explore basic questions about cruelty—what it is, what drives it, in what forms it appears, how it can be resisted—but also to think about what these staged performances do for us. Why do we need them? In what way do they reflect the times and cultures that produced them? What themes and images remain consistent? What does a performance of cruelty allow us to see and experience? We’ll put a range of theatrical texts in conversation with writers like Susan Sontag, Maggie Nelson, Antonin Artaud, Hannah Arendt, and Albert Camus.

Then, we will use other texts to begin interrogating and refining many of Gosse’s foundational assumptions about Irish-American socio-economic and political history, including the fracturing of the Democratic party, the decline of organized labor, the effects of suburbanization, the relationship between Irish-American identity and whiteness, and the relationship between Irish-American identity and Catholicism.

We consider how Italy’s diaspora has affected its conception of itself and examine 500 years of North America as artistic inspiration, as cultural and political influence, and even as a source of existential anxiety. For example, how did European discovery of a “new” continent impact Renaissance authors like Ariosto and Tasso and destabilize the center of their known world? How did American literature like Hemingway and Steinbeck offer 20th-century Italian writers new possibilities of literary expression and political resistance? We consider literature of immigration and travel in the 19th and early 20th centuries, as Italians documented their journeys to North America (and New York City) in poetry and prose. We investigate how Fascism, war and recovery—as well as the physical presence of American soldiers on Italian soil—shifted the political and social stakes of this relationship. Finally, we explore American cultural influence throughout the increasingly globalized 20th century, as US models permeated Italian politics, film, television, music, and food, and pop singers teased teenagers who tried to “fa’ l’americano.” Throughout, we take advantage of our location in New York City to explore aspects of cultural exchange within our urban environment, including an excursion to the Italian American Museum and Little Italy.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:55:27.694Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:55:27.694Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd3c320bd11405a82206f","name":"Death Talk: How We Write About Death, Dying, And Grieving Today","location":"15 Washington Mews, Rm B03 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 3:30PM - 6:00PM","course_number":19628,"department":"[object Promise] (First-Year Seminars)","description":"It has long been said that death has been hidden from view in the modern West. Most people now die in hospitals or old age institutions rather than at home. Older rituals of grief and bereavement have grown marginal, making death less visible in our daily lives. Our media culture privileges youth and vigor rather than aging and death. Certain deaths, such as a child’s, are almost taboo because they contradict our prevailing beliefs about progress, happiness, the sanctity of childhood, and the elimination of risk. And yet, in recent years, there has been an apparent surge of books about death and grief, assisted dying and loss in its multiple forms. These include memoirs and novels, poems and essays by doctors, works of history, sociology, and anthropology. A number of these works have attained critical and popular success. Our goal in this course will be to put these different works in conversation. By analyzing the ways in which these different authors approach the matter, we will seek to determine what may be said about death today. What is audible? What is permissible and publishable? Are we living through a significant transformation of our public discourse about death? Students in this course will engage in both analytical and personal forms of writing about death, grief, and loss.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:55:31.599Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:55:31.599Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd3c720bd11405a822070","name":"Seeing Through Ghosts","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:618 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 2:00PM - 4:30PM","course_number":10147,"department":"[object Promise] (First-Year Seminars)","description":"From Hamlet to Harry Potter, ghosts have long haunted books and film. This seminar asks them questions: What do they want? What do we owe them? When and where do they appear? What are they good for? What do writers and readers use them for? We begin with one of the most famous ghosts in the Western canon, the ghost of Hamlet’s father, to lay the groundwork for our own thinking and responding to the spectral. With the help of Freud’s essays on “The Uncanny” and “Mourning and Melancholia,” and Jacques Derrida’s concept of “hauntology,” we will then pivot to nineteenth-century and contemporary literature—the invention of the “ghost story,” the use of ghosts to confront the history and legacies of slavery in the United States, and a contemporary novel’s cross-cultural exploration of US history and Tibetan Buddhism. In addition to Hamlet (and we will keep an eye out for performances in New York), texts will include Henry James’s “The Jolly Corner” and “The Turn of the Screw,” Mary Wilkins Freeman’s “The Lost Ghost,” Toni Morrison’s Beloved and George Saunders’s Lincoln in the Bardo. Students will work collaboratively, sharing responsibilities for leading discussions and reporting on research.

While New York City gets about twice as many annual visitors, Venice has a stable population of only 55,000 inhabitants and occupies an area smaller than Central Park. Venice is also, famously, a city built on water in the middle of a tidal lagoon. Its small size and unusual site render Venice exceptionally vulnerable to the more pernicious effects of modern mass tourism, including over-crowding, pollution, and an economy increasingly reliant on a single source of revenue. Indeed, for Venetians it has become commonplace to describe the situation as both a social and environmental crisis. Venice, locals often say, is drowning in tourists and under rising sea levels. But in many ways this situation is not new. Venice has always been overrun with outsiders, whether medieval pilgrims, crusaders, and merchants; eighteenth- and nineteenth-century cosmopolitan elites on the so-called Grand Tour; or twentieth- and twenty-first century mass tourists arriving by train, plane, and cruise ship. This seminar will explore the longer history of Venice as a travel destination through documents, literature, and film. In so doing we will consider how Venice has been shaped by its history as a travel destination; how representations of the city affect people’s desire to visit it and their perceptions of the challenges it faces; and how the city’s current tourism-driven economy, when combined with rising sea levels, threatens the city’s very existence.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:56:15.703Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:56:15.703Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd3f320bd11405a82207c","name":"Graves, Bodies, and Books: Funerary Commemorations from Antiquity to the Twenty-First Century","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:618 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Mo 9:30AM - 12:00PM","course_number":19689,"department":"[object Promise] (First-Year Seminars)","description":"In 2014, the start-up company Eterni.me began offering its services to preserve deceased loved ones as 3-D avatars. In the first four days of its existence, the company registered 3,000 people on its site and, consequently, joined the ranks of many other companies in the “e-death” industry that promise to prolong the life of a family member or friend beyond biological death. Companies like Eterni.me—and the digital age, more generally—will surely change the way that societies commemorate their dead; yet humans have always named their dead and marked their final resting places with a monument to ensure that they will be remembered beyond a single generation. We explore the human tendency to locate the dead in society and to engage with them postmortem through a series of literary case studies with a focus on the commemoration of deceased poets, and ask why it is that poets’ tombs are the destination of much literary tourism. Who visits poets’ tombs? What do they do there? How does the tomb help ensure a poet’s “immortality” after his biological death? To answer these and similar questions we study ancient Greek and Latin poetry and the tombs that ancient poets imagine for themselves in their verse. We then turn to a selection of funerary monuments dedicated to Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Romantic poets. Finally, we will consider the twenty-first century’s evolving relationship to traditional modes of commemoration, as well as to digital and experimental forms of memorialization.

We consider several questions: Why and how do filmmakers focus on child characters in their critiques of society, history, power, and discrimination? How do children on screen convey realism and/or nostalgia, future and/or past? Is the thematic rigidity of “childhood in cinema” a productive or a reductive analytical framework?

In this course, we examine both historical and contemporary controversies and developments to investigate how food generates social relations, structures of power, economies, ecologies, and ontological realities. We look to an array of marketing campaigns, social movements, and government initiatives, asking how producing and eating food has material and symbolic consequences for building solidarity among social groups (such as families, clans, voluntary associations, and religious communities) as well as for creating hierarchies and distinctions within such groups.

In short, we will discuss the universe we can see, how we see it, and how we see the universe we cannot. This will include how we see with light, and what we can see with different forms of light. We will discuss other ways of seeing, including relying on neutrinos and gravity. We will discuss how we can see things from the early universe; how we see things like dark matter; and whether it makes sense to talk about things we cannot see, like beyond the observable universe. Along the way, we will develop a basic picture of the history of the universe.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:56:49.251Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:56:49.251Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd41420bd11405a822085","name":"Dictadura: Stories of Tyranny and Liberation in Central America and the Caribbean","location":"45 West 4th St, Rm B04 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 2:00PM - 4:30PM","course_number":19701,"department":"[object Promise] (First-Year Seminars)","description":"The figure of the dictator is one of the recurrent tropes in twentieth-century Latin American literature. The dictator in his fiefdom—the “Banana Republic”—is also one of the classic stereotypes about “dysfunctional” and “unstable” Latin American states. In this seminar we will study some of the canonical Spanish American novels about dictators along with documentary films, primary sources, and selected historiography. We discuss how it is that oppression and seduction so frequently combine to sustain tyrannical regimes. What kinds of fantasies and hopes do tyrants draw on? How do these fantasies compare to what we know from historical sources? What is the role of gender and race in these fantasies about “patriarchs,” “benefactors,” and “liberators”? How do writers, journalists, and artists understand their role in relation to tyrannical regimes? How do they narrate stories of resistance and tyrannicide, and why are these stories so rarely happy ones? What happens after the death of the dictator? Cases to be discussed will likely include the dictatorships of Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, Duvalier in Haiti, Juan Vicente Gomez in Venezuela, and Somoza in Nicaragua. There will be a current affairs component to the course. Students will be asked to research recent events and/or follow the news on the countries we discuss.

Shortly after the invention of writing in the Near East in the late fourth millennium BCE, scribes of the most ancient full-fledged writing system, cuneiform, started to chronicle their own recent or remote past in written form. The texts they left behind include annals, king lists, (pseudo-)biographies, historical omens, and chronicles. These earliest historiographic sources offer a fascinating glimpse into preclassical antiquity and into the events recorded. They also reflect how people in the ancient world perceived time, and how they may have understood their own place in it. The texts studied (all in translation) will be principally Babylonian and Assyrian; a number of Hittite, Biblical, and Greek sources will also be discussed.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:56:56.783Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:56:56.783Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd41c20bd11405a822087","name":"Landscape and Environment from Prehistory to the Present","location":"Bldg:12WV  Room:L111 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Mo 3:30PM - 6:00PM","course_number":19703,"department":"[object Promise] (First-Year Seminars)","description":"Landscapes are dynamic products of interactions between human activities and environmental elements, and landscape archaeology is a discipline that investigates the ways past people formed and transformed their surroundings through time and space.

We will review the main theoretical perspectives and a wide range of methods used in landscape archaeology that can be applied to other disciplines as well. We particularly focus on technological applications including satellite remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), geospatial analysis, methods in field survey, and archaeological site prospection. We will analyze multiple case studies from the ancient Near East and other parts of the world and learn about settlement distribution, water management systems, and diverse land use strategies.

While chemistry is often seen as a science involving matter on a small scale (such as atoms and molecules) and technology is typically thought of on larger scales, materials chemistry bridges these extremes and typically deals with matter in the micron size range (100 times smaller than the width of human hair!). This field uses advancements from chemistry, engineering, physics, and other disciplines and applies them to the real world. Breakthroughs in materials science readily become implemented in technology and influence how humans interact with each other and the world around them. In this seminar, we will explore different types of materials developed over the span of human history (during the Stone and Bronze Ages, the Industrial Revolution, modernity, etc.). We will investigate how the development of these materials then inspired the fabrication of tools and technology across different time periods. Finally, we will highlight developments that led to recent breakthroughs, including materials that are used in smartphones, solar cells, batteries, self-healing devices, and much more.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:57:03.952Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:57:03.952Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd42320bd11405a822089","name":"Music and Those Pesky Emotions","location":"Silver Main, Rm 220 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 2:00PM - 4:45PM","course_number":19705,"department":"[object Promise] (First-Year Seminars)","description":"Everyone talks about music in terms of emotions, taking it on faith that music communicates, expresses, or contains emotions. But no one has ever seen an emotion under a microscope, and no one seems clear about whether the word represents something real, or whether it is a metaphor or a fiction, a stand-in for what we absolutely do not understand. We also do not fully know whether these emotions, if they really exist, can be meaningfully detached from what we call \"ideas\" without vastly misrepresenting human experience.

This course proposes an examination of those political, historical, and aesthetic conjunctures and their effect on the subjectivities of a generation that felt “infinitely foreign” in its own country. Artists, poets, filmmakers, activists, and militants introduced a sense of desire into a political context of discipline and obedience, and by doing so they redefined the meanings of work, sexuality, and everyday life. In addition, they often paid homage to the democratic legacies of the Second Republic of the 1930s and to the avant-gardism of its cultural milieu. Similarly, the recent indignados movement that occupied Spain’s public squares and demanded more radical democratic practices (a movement similar in many ways to Occupy Wall Street) recalled, in turn, the countercultural practices of the 70s. We will study these cross-generational alliances in an effort to understand the relationship of art and aesthetics on one hand and politics on the other.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T04:57:10.908Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T04:57:10.908Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd42a20bd11405a82208b","name":"Dead Sea Scrolls and the Foundations of Judaism and Christianity","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:618 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 4:55PM - 7:25PM","course_number":19707,"department":"[object Promise] (First-Year Seminars)","description":"This seminar investigates the significance of the Dead Sea Scrolls for our understanding of the history of Judaism in ancient times and the development of Christianity.

Most often, these new ideas were announced to the world in the form of manifestoes that were often published and distributed widely, reaching local and international readers; sometimes they were published in limited numbers and handed out on street corners. The intent of their revolutionizing tone, the ambition of their writers, and the impact that these tracts had on the development of modern art will be our central focus throughout the semester. We will develop a critical understanding of the relationship of art to politics during a period of time that saw the development of new political parties, régimes, and models of citizenship across Europe. It was a time in which artists operated as avant-gardists: challenging the status quo and pushing the limits of representation. So, we will also examine the historical \"isms\" that defined this moment in European modern art (Futurism, Dada, Expressionism, Surrealism, etc.).

Second, it helps students develop close and critical reading skills while they learn to express themselves about literary texts in German, both in speaking and in writing. Covering the three major literary genres – poetry, prose, drama – some of the following issues will be discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history; the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:03:12.382Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:03:12.382Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd59420bd11405a8220eb","name":"History of the Jews in 20th Century Europe:","location":"Bldg: ARC  Rm: LL04 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Mo 9:30AM - 12:00PM","course_number":20184,"department":"[object Promise] (German)","description":"\n\n\"History of the Jews in 20th Century Europe: Comparative Perspectives - Italy, Germany, & France.\" Same as HBRJD-UA.200.

Marx’s theory of capitalism centers on the concept of value. Value is the interface between culture and commerce, the hinge on which Marx’s theory and Marxism turn. Although Marx sometimes distinguished between an economic “base” and a legal-cultural “superstructure,” he managed to depict the culture of capitalism as a whole. This method forms one of his crucial legacies, which we will explore in and after Marx. Organized around a slow reading of Capital, Volume 1, the course will also feature short readings from those who inspired Marx (David Ricardo, G. W. F. Hegel, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace) and those his work influenced (Rosa Luxemburg, Theodo W. Adorno, Stuart Hall, Donna Haraway).

Inasmuch as his work tirelessly addresses processes of administration, law, punishment, knowledge production and family structures, it can be considered an analysis of modern institutions and forms of power by means of literature. But these forms of power also inform Kafka’s poetic practice. His literary techniques relate to modern communication systems (postal system) and media technologies used in modern bureaucracy (typewriter, phonograph/sound writer, telephone). In close readings we will examine how the specific performative, rhetorical and material character of Kafka’s texts contribute to the power of writing or what Deleuze/Guattari call a ‘minor literature.’ The course will also explore Kafka’s impact on 20th century literary theory and philosophy (Benjamin, Canetti, Deleuze/Guattari).","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:03:24.012Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:03:24.012Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd5a020bd11405a8220ee","name":"Internship","location":"Bldg: 19UP  Rm: 322 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":2,"time":"Sa 3:00PM - 4:00PM","course_number":8833,"department":"[object Promise] (German)","description":"\n\nPERMISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRED.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:03:28.260Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:03:28.260Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd5a420bd11405a8220ef","name":"Elementary Hebrew I","location":"Bldg:25W4  Room:C-2 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWeFr 9:30AM - 10:45AM","course_number":9746,"department":"[object Promise] (Hebrew & Judaic Studies)","description":"Active introduction to modern Hebrew as it is spoken and written in Israel today.

All of which requires attentiveness to how we tell the story of African American religions, and how scholars have developed and pursued the modern study of “Black religion.”","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:06:34.600Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:06:34.600Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd65e20bd11405a822122","name":"Topics:","location":"Bldg:194M  Room:201 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Mo 2:00PM - 4:45PM","course_number":9295,"department":"[object Promise] (History)","description":"\n\nTrump’s rise has marked the current era of American anti-immigration, but as this course explains, this nativism is not new but rather a resurgent process stretching deeply into the country’s core. For as long as there has been a U.S., there has been a suspicion on the part of its residents of “outsiders.” This category, as we will see, has expanded and contracted through time to include various groups deemed to be an unsavory foreign threat, including Native Americans, the Irish, Italians, Chinese, Arabs, Jews, Mexicans, and Central Americans. Meanwhile, other groups, foremostly Anglo-Saxons – the crème de la crème of “whiteness” in American perceptions – have been given ample accommodation to enter the country for much of the country’s 200-year history, held as they were as ideals of what the nation should strive for demographically. In the process, borders and border-controls, admission and naturalization, and procedures of exclusion, persecution and outright deportation have been used to move the nation closer to its purportedly desirable composition. Bringing these narratives together, the course explores the metamorphosis of the U.S. into not just a country of immigrants, but a country of intense nativism, suspicion, and hostility to outsiders of certain stripes. Throughout, the course will highlight how stakeholders in the American political project have used means both democratic and supra-democratic to impact the question of who can and cannot enter the country, pushing on the one end to erect sturdier barriers to entry – “build that wall” as it were – and on the other, to welcome migrants with more open arms. The course will be based on discussion of selected readings.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:06:38.146Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:06:38.146Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd66120bd11405a822123","name":"The Irish and New York","location":"Ireland House, Rm 102 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 2:00PM - 3:15PM","course_number":9598,"department":"[object Promise] (History)","description":"\n\nThe Irish and New York\n\nExplores the symbiotic relationship between New York City and the Irish from the\n18th through the 20th centuries, as well as the impact of political, social, and cultural\nchanges in Ireland and America on a transnational population.

First, an influential group of scholars have sought to provide a structural explanation and analysis of neoliberalism, linking its emergence and endurance to transformations in the order of global capitalism, particularly the rise of finance capital and the intensification of extractive industries. Second, other scholars, mainly historians, have emphasized the key role played by ideational shifts, especially the movement of marginal economic theories forged in the 1930s into international prominence in the 1970s. A third group of scholars, broadly influenced by Foucault, approach neoliberalism as a new political rationality, manifest in techniques of governance and subjectivation. We will assess these different approaches both on their own terms and in relation to the wider phenomenon at hand, probing the limits and possibilities of alternative paradigms of explanation and descriptive narratives.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:07:59.570Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:07:59.570Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd6b320bd11405a822139","name":"Autobiography and History","location":"King Juan Carlos, Rm 607 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 9:30AM - 12:15PM","course_number":19935,"department":"[object Promise] (History)","description":"\n\nThis course is concerned with historians as autobiographers, and autobiographers as historians.

We will study how knowledge about war is produced and deployed, how it is attached to battlefields and debates on military instruction, and how war has transformed in the frameworks of military 'science', of cultural and intellectual history, and of art history. \n\nWe are particularly interested in historicizing and theorizing the battlefield, defined here as the location where enemies engage. Battlefield has a long history. From prehistoric times to our times, it has appeared in multiple forms and undergone numerous transformations: from a 1-on-1 field where individuals and small groups engage each other with stones, to ever-larger scale battles on the sea, the air, space, information, and more recently cyber-space. Battles \"come\" in different shapes; they occur in different types of spaces and have varying lengths. Yet despite its long history and the just as long history of its representations, the battlefield remains profoundly under-conceptualized and under-theorized. \n\nWith this as a central concern, we will also engage with a series of related questions: the transformation of war over the last century, with the elaboration of new forms of trench and guerilla warfare, air and space battle, and drone and cyberwarfare displacing more traditional siege and naval forms; the uses of violence; the problem of the 'ending' of wars and the highly problematic return to peacetime; questions concerning the laws of war; and the place of the body at war, including in medical interpretations.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:08:25.258Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:08:25.258Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd6cd20bd11405a822140","name":"Seminar:Tpcs in American History","location":"Bldg:1Washington Pl  Room:601 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 12:30PM - 1:45PM","course_number":21671,"department":"[object Promise] (History)","description":"n/a","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:08:29.182Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:08:29.182Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd6d020bd11405a822141","name":"Seminar:Tpcs in American History","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:403 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"TuTh 11:00AM - 12:15PM","course_number":21672,"department":"[object Promise] (History)","description":"\n\nThe workings and even existence of the U.S. Empire have long been cause of controversy. Debates on the subject often touch upon the question of whether the United States is guided by imperial self-interest or the pursuit of freedom. The polemic gained strength after 9/11. Yet, discussions on the nature of U.S. imperialism have centered on rather recent engagements with seemingly distant places like Iraq and Afghanistan. Empire, it would seem, remains a far-from-home phenomenon. Nevertheless, the U.S. Empire is born out of and continues to depend upon interactions in the Americas. This course explores the premise that the U.S. Empire is an American Empire continuously redefined close-to-home through, for example, contested borders, population displacements, political imaginings, military interventions, knowledge exchanges and cultural practices. This is an American Empire inseparable from hemispheric experimentations with the meanings of freedom, democracy and development. The course specifically addresses: How can Empire be understood as a category of analysis? What distinguishes an American Empire? And, how are U.S. imperial formations negotiated “at home”? The course accordingly foregrounds the historical relationship between the U.S. and Latin America in order to question the meanings of home, America and Empire.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:08:32.821Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:08:32.821Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd6d420bd11405a822142","name":"Vietnam: the war & its history","location":"Bldg:194M  Room:210 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":10058,"department":"[object Promise] (History)","description":"\n\nThis course focuses on the American War in Vietnam – its origins, development and the ways it was fought.

Their success gave rise to a multi-national and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century.  The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the “Law of Nations” and the “Law of the Sea,” progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:09:51.198Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:09:51.198Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd72220bd11405a822157","name":"Rebels and Rogues: Political Violence in Early Modern Ireland","location":"Ireland House, Rm 102 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 12:30PM - 1:45PM","course_number":24009,"department":"[object Promise] (Irish Studies)","description":"This course explores a salient feature of the history of early modern Ireland: political","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:09:54.926Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:09:54.926Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd72620bd11405a822158","name":"Colloquium: Joyce","location":"Ireland House, Rm 102 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"TuTh 2:00PM - 3:15PM","course_number":9361,"department":"[object Promise] (Irish Studies)","description":"\n\nJames Joyce’s encyclopedic 1922 novel Ulysses is considered by many to be the greatest literary achievement of the twentieth century.

Women, as the poet Eavan Boland points out, were more frequently enlisted as emblems of the nation, not as literary creators. Perhaps precisely because of this tension, Irish women writers have created some of the country’s most daring and complex works. This class will survey a range of women’s writing in Ireland from the Act of Union (1800) to the present, including poems, novels, short stories, plays, cultural history, and criticism. Some concerns that will organize our discussions include the Protestant “Big House” and its decline, the influence of religion and the state on women’s lives in a newly independent Ireland, the dazzling changes and persistent stereotypes in a radically modernized, demographically transformed twenty-first century Ireland, and the persistent mythic, cultural, and literary trope of woman-as-nation—an image bound up with Ireland’s colonial history.

This course explores these dynamics through the lens of drama and musical theater, focusing in particular on the operatic adaptations of the highly controversial “Figaro trilogy” by French playwright Beaumarchais. By exploring Giovanni Paisiello’s The Barber of Seville (1782), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro (1786), and Gioachino Rossini’s own version of The Barber of Seville (1816) – which opened in Saint Petersburg, Vienna, and Rome, respectively – we will look at the ways in which Italian opera across Europe staged conflicts of class and gender, challenging the assumptions of the aristocracy as well as the ludicrous pretentions of the raising bourgeoisie. The same themes inform the post-modern portrayal of the past in John Corigliano’s The Ghosts of Versailles (1991), which completes the musical afterlife of the Figaro trilogy, providing us with retrospective insight into the working of reception and adaptation. Students will have the possibility to attend a live performance of Mozart’s Le Nozze di Figaro. The course will also include film screenings of Stanley Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon (1975) and Milos Forman’s Amadeus (1984). Conducted in English. 7 seats will be reserved for the first week for Italian Studies majors/minors, Romance Languages majors, and Italian and Linguistics majors. Remaining seats will open to all other NYU students on Saturday 11/16.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:11:52.282Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:11:52.282Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd79b20bd11405a822178","name":"Dante’s Divine Comedy in Context","location":"Casa Italiana, Rm 203 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 2:00PM - 3:15PM","course_number":23554,"department":"[object Promise] (Italian)","description":"Identical to MEDI-UA 269","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:11:55.719Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:11:55.719Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd79f20bd11405a822179","name":"Topics in Italian Lit:","location":"Casa Italian, Rm 306 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 3:30PM - 4:45PM","course_number":10366,"department":"[object Promise] (Italian)","description":"\n\nThis course will explore the contemporary Italian literary scene and its voices, movements, inspirations, similarities and differences.

We will consider the political and aesthetic implications of ugly and opaque emotions like irritation, envy, disgust, and shame. We will also study major influences—including writers Ferrante cites frequently in interviews: Adriana Cavarero, Carla Lonzi, the Milan Women’s Bookstore Collective, Elsa Morante; as well as those she tends to refrain from naming: Christa Wolf and Ingeborg Bachmann.

Haitian Kreyòl is spoken by Haiti’s population of nine million and by about one million Haitians in the U.S. Including over 190,000 in the New York City area. In fact, New York City has the second largest population of Kreyòl Speakers after Port--‐au--‐Prince, Haiti’s capital. Through this course, you will develop introductory speaking, reading, and writing skills. We use a communicative approach, balanced with grammatical and phonetic techniques. Classroom and textbook materials are complemented by work with film, radio, and especially music (konpa, rasin, twoubadou, rap, raga, levanjil, vodou tradisyonèl, etc.), as well as with visits to city museums and institutions related to Haiti.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:15:33.223Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:15:33.223Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd87820bd11405a8221b5","name":"Elementary Haitian Kreyòl II","location":"King Juan Carlos, Rm 404 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWeFr 12:30PM - 1:45PM","course_number":9391,"department":"[object Promise] (Latin Amer-Caribbean Studies)","description":"A continuation of Elementary Haitian Kreyòl I, this course develops","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:15:36.829Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:15:36.829Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedd87c20bd11405a8221b6","name":"Topics in Caribbean Studies","location":"Bldg:25W4  Room:C-20 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"TuTh 11:00AM - 12:15PM","course_number":19942,"department":"[object Promise] (Latin Amer-Caribbean Studies)","description":"4 points, lecture.

Please email mathdugs@cims.nyu.edu for a permission number.\n\nDescription: What is the shortest route between two points? What is the fastest route between the points if the speed limit is not uniform? What is the fastest route if you are not allowed to enter a certain region between the points? How does the two-slit experiment work in quantum mechanics?  These are examples of the kind of problems that arise in the famous calculus of variations, which has widespread applications in physics, continuous optimization, control theory, and probability. This honors class will develop the topic from scratch, starting with the familiar calculus problem of finding the optimal location that minimizes a given function subject to constraints. We will then translate the basic idea to the setting where the unknown is not a location, but a function itself.Examples will be drawn from geometry, mechanics, wave theory, quantum mechanics, control theory, and the probability theory of random walks.  No prior knowledge of physics required.

The course will also cover some theories of consciousness such as mind/body dualism, behaviorism, functionalism, physicalism and theories of consciousness as representation. Among the topics discussed will be some famous thought experiments, such as whether there could be an inverted spectrum in which colors we both call ‘red’ look to you the way colors we both call ‘green’ look to me; and whether Wittgenstein's views of the mind make room for an inverted spectrum; zombie thought experiments; Jackson's example of the scientist raised in a black and white environment who sees red for the first time and learns something about color vision that she could not find out from textbooks.

To a remarkable extent, these two centuries of philosophical thought in Europe provide many of the distinctive concepts, questions, methods, and theoretical approaches that help to structure global philosophy in the twenty-first century. This course will explore some of the early modern period’s most significant contributions to, and its liveliest debates within, the fields of epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of religion, political philosophy, and ethics. In doing so, it will analyze the philosophical systems of René Descartes, Baruch (Benedict) de Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume, together with critical responses to them by such important contemporaries as Pierre Gassendi, Antoine Arnauld, Nicolas Malebranche, Elizabeth of Bohemia, Samuel Clarke, Pierre Bayle, Anne Conway, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Mary Astell, Damaris Masham, Thomas Reid, Mary Shepherd, George Campbell, and Immanuel Kant.\n\nPrerequisite: one introductory course.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:15.698Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:15.698Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deddc9f20bd11405a8222db","name":"History of Modern Philosophy","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:406 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":0,"time":"Mo 11:00AM - 12:15PM","course_number":8487,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"null","component":"Recitation","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:19.423Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:19.423Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deddca320bd11405a8222dc","name":"History of Modern Philosophy","location":"Bldg:BOBS  Room:LL147 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":0,"time":"Mo 2:00PM - 3:15PM","course_number":8488,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"null","component":"Recitation","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:23.290Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:23.290Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deddca620bd11405a8222dd","name":"History of Modern Philosophy","location":"Bldg:BOBS  Room:LL145 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":0,"time":"Fr 9:30AM - 10:45AM","course_number":8489,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"null","component":"Recitation","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:26.964Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:26.964Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deddcaa20bd11405a8222de","name":"History of Modern Philosophy","location":"Bldg:194M  Room:207 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":0,"time":"Fr 11:00AM - 12:15PM","course_number":8490,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"null","component":"Recitation","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:30.713Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:30.713Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deddcae20bd11405a8222df","name":"Kant","location":"Bldg:GCASL  Room:369 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"TuTh 2:00PM - 3:15PM","course_number":19172,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"\n\nThis course seeks to provide an overview of Immanuel Kant’s most famous work, the Critique of Pure Reason. Our focus will be Kant's transcendental idealism, a doctrine he thought would revolutionize philosophy. This idealist doctrine holds that we can only ever know reality as it appears to us, and never reality as it is in itself. Kant thought his idealism was necessary to uphold the claims of modern mathematics and natural science. He also believed his idealism to be an improvement on the two dominant schools of Early-modern philosophy, rationalism and empiricism. After an initial overview of Kant's transcendental idealism, we will consider his attempt, in the first part of the book (\"Aesthetic\") to argue that space and time are, in some sense, mind-dependent. We will then consider his attempt, in the second part (\"Analytic\"), to show that the causal order of nature is similarly mind-dependent. Finally, we will turn to the third part of the book (\"Dialectic\") where Kant presents an idealist critique of traditional metaphysics. For Kant, the failures of traditional metaphysics result from the uncritical assumption that human beings are capable of knowing things as they are in themselves. We conclude by examining the deeper motivation for Kant's idealism: his interest in explaining the possibility of human freedom and moral responsibility. \n\nPrerequisite: one introductory course.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:34.576Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:34.576Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deddcb220bd11405a8222e0","name":"Kant","location":"Bldg: 7E12  Rm: 131 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":0,"time":"Mo 12:30PM - 1:45PM","course_number":19173,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"Study of Kant's metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.","component":"Recitation","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:38.148Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:38.148Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deddcb520bd11405a8222e1","name":"Kant","location":"45 West 4th St, Rm B04 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":0,"time":"We 12:30PM - 1:45PM","course_number":19174,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"Study of Kant's metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.","component":"Recitation","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:41.773Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:41.773Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deddcb920bd11405a8222e2","name":"The Nature of Values","location":"Bldg:GCASL  Room:275 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"TuTh 3:30PM - 4:45PM","course_number":10120,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"\n\nPrerequisite: one introductory course.\n\nThis course’s central question is how to understand the nature of value, especially moral value, in a way that coheres with our best scientific understanding of the world. If a stranger risks her life to save a child who has fallen into the path of an oncoming subway train, we think her action has great value. But what is it for an action (or an object, character trait, or way of life) to have value? And how does the existence of value “fit,” if it fits at all, into our picture of the world as described by science? Are there objective truths about what’s good and bad, right and wrong, moral and immoral? Or is value always “subjective,” in the eye of the beholder? Is it possible to understand purported evaluative truths such as “the good is what promotes happiness” on the model of scientific truths such as “water is H2O”? Or is the subject matter of evaluative discourse utterly different from that of scientific discourse? Are statements about right and wrong capable of being true or false, or are they nothing but sophisticated ways of saying “boo” and “hooray” to conduct we disapprove or approve of? This course will provide a survey of the leading philosophical views on these questions. Readings will include works by Moore, Ayer, Mackie, Railton, Sturgeon, Gibbard, Nagel, Korsgaard, and others.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:45.396Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:33:45.396Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deddcbc20bd11405a8222e3","name":"The Nature of Values","location":"Bldg: 7E12  Rm: 131 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":0,"time":"Mo 2:00PM - 3:15PM","course_number":10121,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"Examines the nature and grounds of judgments about moral and/or nonmoral values.

After broadly surveying and contrasting various philosophical views attempting to answer these questions, we’ll home in on two fundamental features of the mind: consciousness and cognition. Regarding consciousness, we’ll explore the mystery of how subjective experience arises from physical processes. Regarding cognition, we’ll explore the information processing that allows us to reason about and navigate through the world around us. In the end, we’ll explore the possibility of unconscious cognition—mental states of which subjects are not aware—and the implications this possibility has for the objectivity of perception and thought.\n\nPrerequisite: one introductory course.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:34:22.596Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:34:22.596Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deddce220bd11405a8222ed","name":"Philosophy of Mind","location":"Bldg:194M  Room:206 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":0,"time":"Fr 9:30AM - 10:45AM","course_number":19170,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"Examination of the relationship between the mind and the brain, of the nature of the mental, and of personal identity.

Examples include judgments about morality (what ought we to do), rationality (what ought we to believe), and aesthetics (what ought we to appreciate).  We will look at the nature of the normative.  We will examine the reasons why many philosophers have been skeptical that there could be objective facts about the normative.

Finally, we will examine the prospects for defending a realist, objectivist view of such facts in each of the three normative domains specified.\n\nReadings will be drawn from such writers as Mackie, Parfit, Street, Cuneo, Scanlon, Thomson, Harman, Hanson, Boghossian.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:34:47.548Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:34:47.548Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deddcfb20bd11405a8222f4","name":"Topics in Language & Mind","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:510 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 9:30AM - 10:45AM","course_number":9275,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"\n\nPrerequisites: Logic (PHIL-UA 70) and one of the following: Philosophy of Mind (PHIL-UA 80) or Philosophy of Language (PHIL-UA 85)\n\nThis course will concentrate on a small number of central questions in recent philosophy of language and some connected issues in philosophy of mind. Topics to be covered include skepticism about meaning, with special reference to writings of Quine and Kripke; what it is to understand a language, with special reference to the work of Davidson, Dummett and Wittgenstein; the paradoxes of vagueness; the competing accounts of singular thought deriving from Frege and from Kripke; Kripke’s famous argument against the identification of mental states with physical ones; and some puzzles about the first person, ‘I’.

Cities have substantial power over policy areas from education and public safety to transportation, and they also address basic needs: making sure the trash gets taken out, the water runs, and that people are safe from crime. And yet, cities are often quite constrained in their policy choices. For example, one of the central challenges facing municipal government is how to attract and maintain a middle class tax base while providing essential services for low-income residents. This course will explore patterns of city politics against the background of American social and cultural history, including the impulse toward reform and the effects of reform efforts on the distribution of power in the community. Additional topics will include issues related to voting, race and ethnicity, gentrification, and the relationship between cities and the federal government.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:39:47.475Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:39:47.475Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedde2720bd11405a822347","name":"American Field Sem:","location":"Bldg:BOBS  Room:LL142 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Mo 12:30PM - 3:00PM","course_number":10183,"department":"[object Promise] (Politics)","description":"Advanced seminar for juniors and seniors in American politics.

Whenever the choices made by two or more distinct decision makers have an effect on the others? outcomes, the interaction between them is game-theoretic in nature.

Ever since, cultural producers and critics have been trying to answer this question. The first decade or so of the Soviet state was probably the most prolific ground for Marxist art and art theory, until socialist realism became “the basic method of all Soviet art and criticism” in the early 1930s. In the ensuing decades of the twentieth century, leftist thinkers and artists from the West and subsequently, from the Third World, challenged Soviet hegemony on Marxism. The end of the Soviet bloc represented a blow to the left everywhere, especially in Russia, but even there, Marxism, with its attendant aesthetics, still exists. Shifting in and out of Russia, this course will populate this 150-year-long historical trajectory with such canonical texts, authors, and movements as Marx and Engels, Plekhanov, Gorky, Trotsky, the Soviet avant-garde of the 1920s, the socialist realism of the 1930s, Gramsci, Adorno, and the Birmingham School of cultural studies, Mao and Latin American Third Cinema, and as well as such contemporary Russian leftist artists as the Chto Delat’ collective, Kirill Medvedev, Roman Osminkin, and Victoria Lomasko.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:51:21.672Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:51:21.672Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede0dd20bd11405a822405","name":"Russian Culture","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:507 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWe 3:30PM - 4:45PM","course_number":20864,"department":"[object Promise] (Russian & Slavic Studies)","description":"null","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:51:25.336Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:51:25.336Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede0e120bd11405a822406","name":"Theories of Symbolic Exchange","location":"Bldg:19Univ Pl  Room:224 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"TuTh 3:30PM - 4:45PM","course_number":20863,"department":"[object Promise] (Russian & Slavic Studies)","description":"Marcel Mauss developed a concept of an alternative, non-market type of economy, based on a nonmonetary exchange of such symbolic values as social recognition, sovereignty, and political participation.

In this advanced research seminar, we will reflect on the centrality of laboring encounters to the everyday workings of racial capitalism. We will ask: what is at stake in foregrounding laboring encounters as a key mechanism through which racial capitalism has expressed and reproduced itself? To what extent can a focus on everyday laboring relationships offer ways of thinking relationally across the multiple spaces, times, and scales of racial capitalist exploitation and violence? And how might such inquiries open up opportunities for building new infrastructures of internationalism and solidarity building? In addition to the lectures and discussions around this topic, class participants will employ a combination of archival, ethnographic, and community-based methods to carry out individual or collective research projects. Our aim will be to create material, resources, and language for forging new kinds of anti-capitalist, anti-imperial, and decolonial futures.

Is it electing political representatives every few years, taking to the streets in collective protest, or is it something entirely different? Indeed, what does ‘rule of the people’ actually mean in terms of the distribution of power, wealth, and freedom across society? In this course, we’ll take a journey through various democratic ideals and democratic systems in contemporary times, and we’ll do so from a global and comparative perspective in order to unravel the relationships between democracies and despotisms. Students not only interrogate why people struggle for democracy against despotic rule, and why they then ‘succeed’ or ‘fail’ in creating institutional change, but also how undemocratic, unfree, and unequal realities can thrive within and challenge democracies. Our inquiry into such questions is informed by how revolutions have helped create these political ideals and practices and what they say about social inequalities. To do so, we’ll examine case studies and cross-national comparisons. While we’ll study cases from Europe, Latin America, and East Asia, we center the 2011 Arab Spring and renewed popular mobilization in the Middle East/North Africa as well as critical junctures in the U.S., from the Civil Rights Movement to current struggles unfolding across the country.

The term “transpacific” has recently become a popular framework for analyzing the global circulations of bodies, commodities, capital, and culture that have historically linked the Pacific world. This course considers the transpacific as a fundamentally geographical formation. It asks: where is the transpacific? And how might we locate it in relation to other diasporic formations, including Asian America, Asian Canada, Inter-Asia, the Asian Caribbean, and the Indigenous Pacific? This course wrestles with these questions by exploring how geographical concepts such as space, place, and scale might enrich our understandings of the everyday processes through which transpacific lifeworlds are made, re-made, and un-made. Guided by such an approach, we will attend to the longer-standing historical geographies of Indigenous place-making and solidarity-building that have always exceeded transpacific imperial formations. Our objective here will be to emphasize the decolonial struggles that have emerged in the contact zones between these Indigenous and imperial Pacifics.

Rising levels of political polarization – where both citizens and political elites have moved apart in ways that make civil discourse and reasoned compromise possible – are one sign of this crisis. The successful campaign of real estate mogul Donald Trump to win the presidency in 2016 divided the country along racial and ethnic lines. The many scandals of the Trump Administration since assuming office have proved difficult for Congress, the media, and the courts to police, and Trump’s own behavior in office has also routinely ignored basic norms of democratic institutions. In this course, we will consider how the current crisis emerged, how and in what ways the Trump presidency represents a basic challenge to American political institutions, why democratic institutions have proved ineffectual in the face of the Trump presidency, and whether we are entering a new “era” of political contention in which Trump’s style of campaigning and governing will continue after he leaves office.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:58:12.482Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:58:12.482Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede27720bd11405a822475","name":"Adv Sem:","location":"295 Lafayette, Rm 4130 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":10414,"department":"[object Promise] (Sociology)","description":"\n\nThis course will introduce students to the complexities of conceptualizing and studying power.

Topics in the study of fairness include the four major fairness processes – ideas of just rewards, determination of actual rewards, evaluations of the fairness or unfairness of actual rewards, and behavioral and social consequences of the fairness evaluations. Topics in the study of the inequality-justice connection include the exact connection between inequality and fairness in a variety of social scenarios, links between input inequality and outcome inequality, model-based inequality effects of the sense of justice, and links between the goodness or badness of things and the goodness or badness of their inequality.

How do we assess where the truth lies?","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:58:24.000Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:58:24.000Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede28320bd11405a822478","name":"Seminar:","location":"295 Lafayette, Rm 4130 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Th 9:30AM - 12:10PM","course_number":19798,"department":"[object Promise] (Sociology)","description":"See the student services administrator for content and other information.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:58:27.536Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:58:27.536Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede28720bd11405a822479","name":"Seminar:","location":"295 Lafayette, Rm 4155 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Th 12:30PM - 3:10PM","course_number":9651,"department":"[object Promise] (Sociology)","description":"null","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:58:31.279Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:58:31.279Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede28a20bd11405a82247a","name":"Seminar:","location":"295 Lafayette, Rm 4155 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Mo 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":9484,"department":"[object Promise] (Sociology)","description":"Prerequisite: junior standing and three courses in sociology, including Introduction to Sociology (V93.0001), or written permission of the instructor. 4 points.

Is it electing political representatives every few years, taking to the streets in collective protest, or is it something entirely different? Indeed, what does ‘rule of the people’ actually mean in terms of the distribution of power, wealth, and freedom across society? In this course, we’ll take a journey through various democratic ideals and democratic systems in contemporary times, and we’ll do so from a global and comparative perspective in order to unravel the relationships between democracies and despotisms. Students not only interrogate why people struggle for democracy against despotic rule, and why they then ‘succeed’ or ‘fail’ in creating institutional change, but also how undemocratic, unfree, and unequal realities can thrive within and challenge democracies. Our inquiry into such questions is informed by how revolutions have helped create these political ideals and practices and what they say about social inequalities. To do so, we’ll examine case studies and cross-national comparisons. While we’ll study cases from Europe, Latin America, and East Asia, we center the 2011 Arab Spring and renewed popular mobilization in the Middle East/North Africa as well as critical junctures in the U.S., from the Civil Rights Movement to current struggles unfolding across the country.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:58:41.976Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:58:41.976Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede29520bd11405a82247d","name":"Independent Study","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":2,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":8638,"department":"[object Promise] (Sociology)","description":"\n\nPERMISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRED.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:58:45.677Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:58:45.677Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede29920bd11405a82247e","name":"Independent Study","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":2,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":9396,"department":"[object Promise] (Sociology)","description":"null","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T05:58:49.229Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T05:58:49.229Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede29d20bd11405a82247f","name":"Spanish for Beginners- Level I","location":"Bldg:TISC  Room:LC2 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"TuThFr 8:00AM - 9:15AM","course_number":8641,"department":"[object Promise] (Spanish)","description":"\n\nSPAN-UA 1  Open to students with no previous training in Spanish and to others on assignment by placement test. 4 points.\nDesigned to teach the elements of Spanish grammar and language structure using primarily a proficiency approach involving listening, speaking, reading and writing.

A key aim here is to challenge the idea of the exceptionalism of Spanish history and culture, showing how Spain has engaged with issues of modernity from a range of perspectives. We will pay attention to the ways in which cultural texts deal with the national past and engage with other cultures (including African American culture, North African\nculture, and Latin American culture). We will be particularly interested in the ways in which\ncultural production helps to negotiate tensions surrounding memories of the past and new ways\nof imagining the future.

How do we know (or think we know) what we do about bodies and desires in the past and present? How and why do certain bodies come to be recorded, documented, and remembered in the first place? Insofar as the archives serve as a site for historical accumulation, visitation, and recognition they become an exemplary space for academic, activist, and community contests over the proper or desirable boundaries of sex, gender, and knowledge. Yet, how do bodily reminders and documented desires change in meaning and form depending on the nature of the document (be it a website, photograph, letter, diary, home video, criminal trial, medical record, literary text, etc.) and the technique of documentation employed in the act of recording? \nThis seminar examines the notion of “archives of the body” through the lenses of sexuality, desire, and memory in the Americas.  We will explore topics including, but not limited to, the following: archival activism; animal bodies in zoos and taxidermy exhibits; representations of monstrosity in museums and natural history collections; colonialism and criminality (as tied to sexuality) in Latin America; the history of photography and film in the Americas; and, early twentieth-century Latin American eroticism as sites of cultural criticism, among other topics. We will actively engage local NYC-based archives in order to think through the complex ways that particular bodies come to be represented and remembered by and through diverse forms of archiving.  This course invites us to think differently about how bodies and desires make their way into a particular historical, literary, and visual records, and as such we will be analyzing techniques of representation alongside their proper cultural and historical contexts. \nNote: This course will be conducted in Spanish, and grading will be based on reading reactions (in class and at home), course participation, presentations, written assignments, and an in-class exam.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:03:55.751Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:03:55.751Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede3cf20bd11405a8224cf","name":"Spanish Cinema 1960s to Present","location":"Bldg:194M  Room:202 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 12:30PM - 3:00PM","course_number":19043,"department":"[object Promise] (Spanish)","description":"\n\nThe course, taught in Spanish, offers a survey of Spanish cinema from the 1960s to the present, through the study of 12 key films, which will be made available for viewing (you should expect to spend time viewing them carefully).

Aunque se concentrará en estudiar las aportaciones críticas y teóricas de América Latina y el Caribe a este panorama internacional, el mismo partirá de una perspectiva comparada que revele tanto las articulaciones locales de cada contexto como las respuestas comunes que son específicas a la historia colonial y moderna de las Américas, caracterizada por la explotación de las comunidades nativas, la inmigración, y los procesos acelerados de modernización e industrialización. Esta perspectiva nos permitirá problematizar la dicotomía centro-periferia que todavía informa la comprensión de la cultura política de las Américas. El curso también tendrá un componente interactivo de trabajo de campo en donde exploraremos distintos archivos, instituciones culturales, organizaciones, y lugares emblemáticos del feminismo en la ciudad de Nueva York para fomentar una perspectiva localizada y comparada de los materiales estudiados en clase.\nNuestra comprensión del feminismo girará en torno a su capacidad creativa de generar modos alternativos de organización e imaginación del mundo, los cuerpos y la vida cotidiana en un panorama histórico en continua transformación. Para esto, estudiaremos textos literarios, películas, documentales, distintos ejemplos de las artes visuales y musicales, archivos históricos y la producción cultural de distintos colectivos. El énfasis en la creatividad nos permite entender el feminismo como un movimiento inclusivo, sin un sujeto político predeterminado o monolítico, y predicado en la comprensión y visibilización de distintas formas de marginalización y explotación del trabajo sobre las que se construyen los sistemas de opresión actuales. Por ello, este curso es especialmente pertinente para contextualizar la resistencia y las formas de organización que contrarrestan la criminalización de la inmigración, la violencia de género, la explotación de los recursos naturales y la normalización de la guerra.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:04:28.972Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:04:28.972Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede3f020bd11405a8224d8","name":"Contemporary Latin American Novel","location":"Bldg:TISC  Room:LC13 Loc: Washington Square","school":"College of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"TuTh 2:00PM - 3:15PM","course_number":10042,"department":"[object Promise] (Spanish)","description":"\n\n¿En qué consiste la contemporaneidad de la novela actual latinoamericana? ¿Cómo sigue las claves consabidas del siglo XX y en qué sentido se aparta de ellas? ¿Es conservadora o radical?

This course proposes an examination of those political, historical, and aesthetic conjunctures and their effect on the subjectivities of a generation that felt ‘infinitely foreign’ in the Spain of the time. By redefining the meanings of work, sexuality, and everyday life through the introduction of desiring subjects into a scene of discipline and obedience, artists, poets, filmmakers, activist, and militants often paid homage to the democratic legacies of the Second Republic in the 1930s and to the avant-gardism of its cultural milieu. Similarly, the more recent indignados movement that occupied Spain’s public squares and demanded more radical democratic practices recalled, in turn, the countercultural practices of the 70s.  We will study these cross-generational alliances in an effort to understand the convergence of aesthetics and politics in the often short-lived experimental communities of contemporary Spain.\nWe will read theoretical texts by Walter Benjamin, Jacques Rancière, Michel Foucault, Henri Lefebvre, Paul Ricoeur, Chantal Mouffe;  poetry and prose from Rafael Alberti, Federico García Lorca, Jorge Semprún, Juan Marsé, Ramón Gómez de la Serna, Gabriel Ferrater, Leopoldo Panero, Belén Gopegui; films by Luís Buñuel, Pere Portabella, Joaquím Jordà, Oliver Laxe, and Isaki Lacuesta.

In this course, we will discuss the application of techniques from machine learning and statistics to a variety of criminal justice issues, analyze recent court decisions, and examine the relationships between law, public policy, and data.  The course will involve readings and class discussion, short assignments, and a data-intensive semester-long project.  The course will also feature guest speakers who work in the criminal justice domain.  Students should have basic knowledge of statistics, programming, and supervised machine learning, but no prior knowledge of the criminal justice system will be assumed.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:16:21.290Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:16:21.290Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede6b820bd11405a82259c","name":"Advanced Topics in Urban Science & Informatics","location":"370 Jay Street, Room 308 Loc: Brooklyn Campus","school":"Ctr for Urban Sci and Progress","units":3,"time":"Tu 11:30AM - 2:20PM","course_number":23224,"department":"[object Promise] (Ctr for Urban Sci and Progress)","description":"Advanced topics courses are designed to address timely issues and the","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:16:24.732Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:16:24.732Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede6bc20bd11405a82259d","name":"Monitoring Cities","location":"2 MetroTechCr Rm 845 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Ctr for Urban Sci and Progress","units":3,"time":"Mo 6:00PM - 8:30PM","course_number":7560,"department":"[object Promise] (Ctr for Urban Sci and Progress)","description":"The world’s urban population is growing by nearly 60 million per year; equivalent to four cities like New York annually.

One can, however, track the rise of diagnoses of collective trauma over the last several decades, wherein a given community is understood as having been “traumatized” by a catastrophic event such as genocide or an enduring form of oppression such as extreme poverty. Collective trauma is alternatively referred to as communal, historical, or cultural trauma. This form of trauma is thought to emanate from cultural upheaval and formidable challenges to the social and moral order. This course turns to a variety of theoretical and empirical sources—ranging from case studies of Holocaust survivors, to critical theories of trauma, to documentary films about First Nation communities and the Rwandan genocide, to 911 Memorial exhibitions, for example—in order to help map the contours of this emergent discourse and explore some of its social, psychological, and political implications. We will attempt to critically engage this growing tendency to place various modes of communal suffering in the psychological rubric of trauma. What are the differences and points of overlap between individual and collective trauma? To what extent is collective trauma an adequate framework for understanding or responding to communal suffering? We will read from the collections Acts of Memory: Cultural Recall in the Present; Rites of Return: Diaspora Poetics and the Politics of Memory; Memory: Histories, Theories, Debates;and Trauma at Home: After 9/11 as well as writings by Michael Rothberg, Marianne Hirsch, James Young, Jan and Aleida Assman, and Giorgio Agamben.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:17:21.712Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:17:21.712Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede6f520bd11405a8225ad","name":"Home and the World: A Seminar on Modern Iranian Intellectual Trends","location":"KEVO Library, Ground Floor Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Grad","units":4,"time":"We 4:55PM - 7:35PM","course_number":19955,"department":"[object Promise] (Electives)","description":"This graduate seminar explores some of the central themes in modern Iranian intellectual history.  The primary focus of the course will be the transnational circulation of intellectual discourses in contemporary Iran.  Intellectual and religious ideas travel in time and space. This is the case with modern ideas, but also with ideas we consider as “traditional” or “local.” Iranian intellectual thought came to interact and overlap with Western liberalism, European and Russian social democracy, French and German Counter-Enlightenment, among others. European thought has traveled to Iran, but, Persian and Islamic traditions have also journeyed to Europe, only to then return to contemporary Iran. The cases of Ahmad Fardid, Ali Shari’ati, and Henry Corbin are conspicuous examples of the reciprocal traveling lifecycle of intellectual ideas and traditions.  The course is designed to study three intellectual currents in contemporary Iran.  However, we will pay special attention to how these intellectual trends overlap, mutually borrow, and share similar origins in past Iranian or European traditions.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:17:25.112Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:17:25.112Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede6f820bd11405a8225ae","name":"Femininity, Postfeminism and Mass Media","location":"Bldg:1Washington Pl  Room:601 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Grad","units":4,"time":"Mo 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":6275,"department":"[object Promise] (Electives)","description":"Postfeminism is an ambiguous and often contradictory term whose very indeterminacy speaks to the difficulties in understanding contemporary relationships between feminism, femininity, citizenship and identity. Positioned simultaneously as a backlash against feminism, a testament to achieved gender equality, as a reclamation of traditional feminine values and a sign of female success, postfeminism’s significance is widely felt even as its specific meanings and cultural effects appear unclear. This class will examine postfeminism’s relationship to feminism and femininity, situating all three as historically and culturally significant manifestations of the female self. Closely linked to the development of neoliberalism with its emphasis on self-reliance, choice and privatization, postfeminism is largely a product of consumer culture and mass media that have particularly consequences for feminine identities and gender relations. This course will look at popular women’s media from the makeover show, to fashion magazines and blogs, chick films and television drama to explore how they manage tradition and promote a more privatized and commercial feminine self, negotiating the relationship between family responsibilities and more laissez faire ideas of female success and self-actualization.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:17:28.964Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:17:28.964Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede6fc20bd11405a8225af","name":"Media, Migration and Race","location":"Bldg:1Washington Pl  Room:527 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Grad","units":4,"time":"Tu 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":20125,"department":"[object Promise] (Electives)","description":"Racialized media narratives about migrants and the “migration crisis” have transformed politics in the US, but also across much of the world in the past several years.

We will locate the current crisis in much longer histories of settler colonialism, transatlantic slavery, forced migration and indenture that have shaped modern political struggles over race, nationality and citizenship. We will then turn to the role of media across platforms and technologies in surveilling and policing on the one hand and setting the limits on the other, of 21st century public understandings of national belonging and claims to citizenship within and beyond borders.

But listening—to music or to anything else—has often been rendered as a passive activity, as the opposite of asserting, doing, achieving. It can’t be quantified. It doesn’t leave an immediate record. It can look like wasted time. There are no Grammy awards or Pulitzer Prizes for listening. (There should be. Perhaps there will be.) This is a seminar in reading about listening and writing about it—as personal essay, philosophy, or criticism. Primarily, though not exclusively, this class is about listening to music—electronic music, hiphop, rock and roll, jazz; notated and improvised music and anything else. We will think, read, and write about about listening as physical experience of sound, and as trance-state; listening as surveillance; listening with headphones vs. collective listening; two definitions of “social listening” (listening from a particular social identity, and social media-monitoring); deep-listening exercises developed by Pauline Oliveros and other 20th century composers; listening to the streaming-media algorithm, playlist, and DJ; listening to nature; the rise of concert and dance-music culture since the 1830s; and recent thoughts about the importance of listening in politics, education, and civil society. We will also draw from outside experience, and so this class may require attendance in a sound-walk and a musical performance in which there is a particular emphasis on the listening experience.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:18:23.696Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:18:23.696Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede73320bd11405a8225bc","name":"Creative Nonfiction: From Idea to Essay","location":"Bldg:BOBS  Room:837 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"Mo 6:20PM - 9:00PM","course_number":14048,"department":"[object Promise] (Advanced Writing Courses)","description":"Some of the strongest nonfiction writing out there—whether cultural criticism, the reported personal essay, or an historical nonfiction narrative—grew from the flimsiest of tendrils: a hunch, a spark, an enthusiasm.

The hallmark of the personal essay is its intimacy—the sharing of the writer’s observations and reflections with a reader, establishing a dialogue on subjects that range from the mundane to autobiographical and political meditations to reflections on abstract concepts and moral dilemmas. Style, shape, and intellectual depth lend the personal essay its drama, charm, and its ability to provoke thought.

Special emphasis will be given to rehearsal frameworks that cultivate an understanding of the collaborative nature of directing as well as build equitable and inclusive spaces fostering generosity, encouragement, and risk-taking. Throughout the course particular attention will be given to the relationship between form and content, modes of spectatorship, and the political and philosophical implications of staging choices. Students will attend and analyze productions in New York City, present and observe creative work using a vocabulary for critical analysis, and keep a journal responding to readings. Our investigation is intended to lead to the development of an individual voice for each student and clarity in one’s directorial point of view.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:19:38.851Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:19:38.851Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede77e20bd11405a8225d1","name":"Oral History, Cultural Identity and The Arts","location":"Bldg:1 Washington Pl  Room:430 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"Mo 6:20PM - 9:00PM","course_number":14002,"department":"[object Promise] (Arts Workshops)","description":"Oral history is a complex process in the creation of artistic projects across the disciplines: documentary film, theatre, book arts, exhibitions, interactive websites, public radio, etc. This course offers training in interviewing and editing techniques, and looks at the ethics and impact of “truth-telling” on the people we interview, their families and friends, ourselves and the culture at large.

Embarking on a photographic project of their design, students depict a highly visible urban space (viewed as a world financial, cultural, artistic capital) through their own relationship to it: their ways of interacting, acting, and being moved. Classes prepare students to work on their position as photographers: as they make pictures in the streets of New York, they determine their own perception (vantage point, angle, point of view, framing) and establish a particular relationship with the audience (through scale, rhythm sequence, position, color). Exploring the boundaries between public and private space, feeling space and scale with the body (and not only with one's eyes) and creating a personal color palette are strongly encouraged. Students also explore a photographer's power to change audience perception, for example, through large scale installations inciting viewers to inhabit particular vantage points. Though documentary imagery is traditionally considered to establish a transparent relation to 'reality,' this course challenges students to recognize its created character and to recreate the city by influencing with their photographic intervention the ways it is perceived.

Demand for food, water, housing, energy, products, and services has grown at an even faster pace. In response to these issues, the design professions have created new concepts for green architecture, sustainable cities, alternative infrastructure, and recycled products. They've also developed new laws and environmental standards. This course presents green design and planning concepts through readings, discussions, lectures, films, and projects. Students write a short paper and create three design projects. The papers examine issues such as energy, transportation, recycling, planning, and design. The projects include design of a recycled product, a roof terrace or small green building, and analysis of a park or neighborhood. The projects are developed through maps, diagrams, photographs, and architectural drawings. Design techniques and programs, such as Sketchup, are also introduced.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:20:54.574Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:20:54.574Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede7ca20bd11405a8225e6","name":"Designing for New Climates: Histories of Adaption","location":"Bldg:1 Washington Pl  Room:501 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"Mo 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":20113,"department":"[object Promise] (Arts Workshops)","description":"The course explores how design can respond to environmental problems and climate change.

Borges reveals that labyrinth to be a sprawling book in which all moments in time are followed by every possible subsequent moment. Multiple futures and timelines exist as one in this garden of forking paths. Fast forward to today, where we find that Ts’ Ui Pen’s seemingly incomprehensible vision has come to fruition via video games and interactive fiction. Both often eschew linearity and instead offer users the opportunity to drive the story and shape their own narrative experience.  In this course, we will first explore the trajectory of interactive fiction, from its early overtures in works by Borges and Italo Calvino, forward through Agusto Boal’s Forum Theatre, early computer text adventures, Choose Your Own Adventure books, non-linear film, and into the various digital interactive fictions of today, such as hypertext literature, adventure games, and visual novels.  From there, students will embark on their own adventure through interactive creative writing. The journey will begin with students taking apart and diagraming existing interactive works, and using digital tools to craft and share their own short interactive scenes and dialogs. We will confront the challenges and limitations of writing interactive story and establish some key critical theories governing non-linearity. The course will culminate in students designing and writing a complete short work of interactive fiction in a medium of their choice.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:21:05.625Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:21:05.625Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede7d520bd11405a8225e9","name":"Future Reality: Trends and Impact of New Media","location":"Bldg:1 Washington Pl  Room:501 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"Fr 2:00PM - 4:45PM","course_number":14033,"department":"[object Promise] (Arts Workshops)","description":"Augmented reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed reality (MR) have come to be an integral part of new media culture.

How have writers and activists sought to change society through changing how we use language? How is rhetoric used politically, in essays, law, oratory, propaganda, and poetry? We read arguments about the interplay of language and the political, think about political theory, examine political rhetoric, and study literary works. We write about the power of rhetoric to form and criticize political practices: movements for civil rights, human rights, rights for women, workers’ rights, and animal rights. We investigate in detail how language participates in our ideas about rights, ethics, political action, and social justice.  And we examine the affective dimensions of this interaction of language, ideas, and values. After familiarizing ourselves with various approaches to thinking about political and social relations, you can then explore in depth an issue of social justice that animates you. This means that we use the reading to focus your critical thinking capacities, expand your horizons, and communicate the results of these processes in writing that is persuasive, coherent, exhilarating, meaningful.

It also represents justice as tied to a state of equilibrium, which can be completely restored. Yet justice itself is very difficult to define, shifting its meanings over time, between cultures and among individuals; can we presume such a balance? Is justice really only an effect of power, the right of the strong to define the terms under which the weak live? How are law and justice connected? While these seem to be questions for political philosophers, they have also been addressed by literary writers. In this course, our focus will be on how literary texts take up these problems at different junctures primarily in the Western tradition. We will also read some jurists and critical theorists on what constitutes justice—and for whom. Readings may include Plato, Aeschylus, Herman Melville, Bertolt Brecht, Richard Wright, Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Martha Nussbaum, and Nadine Gordimer.

They often gain from these predecessors—in some ways of thinking, their ancestors—a sense of a long-standing historical and cultural identity, and use the past to shape that nation’s relationships to the landscape, to cultural traditions, and even to other nations. Archaeology, including the excavation, preservation, and interpretation of monuments and artefacts, often plays an active part in the construction of these national pasts, contributing to national narratives that claim long, continuous cultural histories, that delineate territory, that present a golden age and the promise of its return, or that give the members of the national community cause to come together. This course investigates the ways in which the archaeological remains have been employed in the shaping of modern national identities.

Over seven thousand miles of sewers undergird the five boroughs of New York; centuries of occluded catastrophe dictate the architectural fabric of modern London; and in metropolises around the world the labor of an unacknowledged precariat lets us pass through the urban everyday without reflection. This course looks at how these invisible cities are made visible through literature. We’ll grapple with the pathological, the potential, the evanescent, and even the scatological, as we ask how literature maps on to hidden registers of the built environment. Alongside conventional exercises in essay writing, research, and in-class presentations, students can expect to put theory into practice with assignments involving urban exploration, literary fieldwork, and urban audition. Writing requirements will include formal papers responding to readings; an exploration journal linking texts and experiences; construction of a city itinerary (and corresponding reaction to a classmate’s); and a final research project (which can, with permission, incorporate creative elements).

Although centered on the contemporary, we will place this relationship within a wide historical and theoretical context and will make our considerations across a global frame of reference. Beginning with the patronage system that helped to make the Renaissance possible, extending all the way up to crowd sourcing today, our analysis will track the aesthetic and cultural impact money has had over the arts. Our aim is to understand money and its metaphors within artistic, philosophical, and cultural spheres. We will investigate not only how means of cultural production have changed, but also how the contemporary global capitalist superstructure has changed our relationship to cultural production and creativity. Special emphasis will be given to the contemporary movement toward individual producer-consumers, and we will centrally examine works of art and literature that take money as an object of thought and investigation. This element—the examination of works overtly about money and its meanings—will make up a substantial element of the course, and will serve as the grounds where our more theoretical investigations become concretized.

Our experiences in these places are designed to remind us that the body is a site for the accumulation and transmission of knowledge--we will rely on all of our senses to conduct research. In our writing and discussion sessions we practice transmitting what we see, smell, touch, taste, hear, and feel when we study.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:21:58.984Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:21:58.984Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede80a20bd11405a8225f8","name":"First-Year Research Seminar: Representations of Disability in Contemporary Memoir","location":"Bldg:BOBS  Room:LL139 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"MoWe 2:00PM - 3:15PM","course_number":14133,"department":"[object Promise] (First Year program)","description":"In this course, we will pursue analysis of contemporary memoir through the lens of disability representation, considering the ways the complexities of the body and mind are translated by authors onto the page.

Since the earliest European settlement, America has provided a refuge for the poor, the disadvantaged, and religiously persecuted seeking a new life. Yet American history has also been crucially defined by those immigrants who came here unwillingly or under duress, whether African slaves, indentured servants, or refugees. The continual, cheap source of labor that immigration has provided helped fuel the growth of American capitalism, but has also undermined the privileges of established groups, often provoking nativism along racial, ethnic, and religious lines. In this regard, the history of immigration is inextricable from the politics of the Other. Topics we will explore include the role of immigration in driving capitalism and shaping its radical critics; the legal history of citizenship before and after the 14th Amendment; the rise of exclusion, borders, and quotas to define legal and illegal persons; and the relation between American national identity and cultural diversity. Course readings will draw on the work of Barbara J. Fields, Edmund Morgan, William Novak, John Higham, Beth Lew-Williams, Mae Ngai, Isabel Wilkerson, and Jonathan Gold as well as selected primary sources and cultural texts. In addition to two short papers, students will be introduced to methods of archival research and expected to make use of primary sources for a longer research paper.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:22:06.254Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:22:06.254Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede81120bd11405a8225fa","name":"First-Year Research Seminar: A Tale of Two Caesars","location":"Bldg:1 Washington Pl  Room:401 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"TuTh 9:30AM - 10:45AM","course_number":14135,"department":"[object Promise] (First Year program)","description":"For ancient Rome, the shift from republic to empire meant the unprecedented centralization of power within a single figure. This course explores the rise and reign of Rome’s most remembered autocrats, Julius Caesar and Caesar Augustus, analyzing the birth of the Roman empire from both contemporary and current perspectives. How did Caesar disrupt the traditional dynamics of Roman society? How did the rise of Augustus complicate Roman paradigms of power? And what can these ancient autocrats teach us about leadership and authority in the modern world? Together we examine these questions in context, including the notion of the Pax Romana and Pax Americana, considering also the relationship between power, state, and people within various facets of ancient and modern society. We will utilize both primary texts in translation and secondary sources on the reception of Caesarian politics and the ethics of empire. Readings include Vergil, Ovid, Shakespeare, Hannah Arendt, Duncan Kennedy, and Clifford Ando.

The images are juxtaposed across the pages with multiple insets, portraying that same spot in hundreds of moments, as if McGuire were using magic glasses: 1949 (a mother cradles an infant), 1993 (a teenager dances), 1624 (before there was a house), 10,000 B.C. (before there were any houses: a bison sits in marshland).  McGuire’s point, or one of them, is that history doesn’t need monuments—we walk on its layers everywhere and at all times.  The musical history of the 20-block radius around NYU has been historicized a lot—particularly the history of the same few places in the late 1970s, and particularly CBGBs.  But longstanding New Yorkers look at the whole area with McGuire glasses.  It doesn’t matter how many Duane Reades have masked the sites: things happened here, in hip hop, jazz, Afro-Latin music, experimental music, punk and no wave, opera, and onward. This class will research specific events and sites in downtown music history, including the Roxy, the New Rican Village, the Five Spot, the Paradise Garage, the Mudd Club, and the Cantonese opera houses on the Bowery in the 1920s.  We will learn how to determine what is reliable and what is yet to be understood in a subject as volatile and often misrepresented as urban nightlife.  Our materials will include books; oral histories; newspaper accounts; photographs, flyers and ephemera accessible at NYU’s Fales Collection and other special New York-based collections; and on-the-ground interviewing and research.  Aside from readings and writing assignments, we will write about musical happenings that define downtown New York now, and create our own layered musical map.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:22:13.380Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:22:13.380Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede81820bd11405a8225fc","name":"First-Year Research Seminar: The Everyday Gothic","location":"Bldg:1Washington Pl  Room:601 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"MoWe 9:30AM - 10:45AM","course_number":14147,"department":"[object Promise] (First Year program)","description":"We often associate the gothic with explicitly supernatural or morbidly sinister elements: haunted castles, bloodthirsty vampires, gruesome deaths. But alongside such overtly terrifying aspects, there are subtler instances of the gothic that swarm our quotidian existence: the eerie message from a bot on our screens; the shady character on the subway staring maliciously; an unexpected elevator altercation that escalates into a grotesque crime. How to think of such insidious forces that interrupt the normal flow of our mundane existence and perturb the ostensible safety of our routines? What are the economic, political, social, and cultural factors that shape our perception and comprehension of such occurrences, as well as our reactions and responses to them? In this class, we will study the multifarious manifestations of the gothic and will consider it both as a literary and cinematic mode of representation and as a critical tool for sociocultural analysis. We will begin by reading canonical texts by Horace Walpole, Mary Shelley, and Edgar Allan Poe in order to develop a sophisticated understanding of the gothic as an aesthetic.

Much like the case study, microhistory focuses on individual objects, events, persons, families, or communities. Yet while a case study examines the singular in order to demonstrate broader patterns or theses, microhistory seeks to illuminate the uniqueness of the individual instance – the anomalies and disruptions that resist overly simplistic explanations and stereotypical definitions. During the course of the semester, students will analyze the construction of classic microhistories: a sixteenth century imposter who managed for three years to integrate himself into the life of another man, a troop of ordinary men who somehow became able to commit horrific acts of genocide, an eighteenth century clockmaker who revolutionized mapmaking and the future of world travel. Then students will devise and execute microhistory projects of their own about any era or geographic region that they wish to study. Along the way, students will ultimately develop a keener eye – an eye for the unusual, for the unfamiliar, and for the infinite improvisations and innovations that human beings can perform, even within the most limiting and oppressive structures of society and culture.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:22:20.487Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:22:20.487Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede82020bd11405a8225fe","name":"First-Year Research Seminar: Time Travel: Science, Fiction, and the Western Imagination","location":"Bldg: ARC  Rm: LL02 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"MoWe 11:00AM - 12:15PM","course_number":20117,"department":"[object Promise] (First Year program)","description":"This seminar will examine the idea of time travel from the perspectives of Western literature, popular culture, philosophy, physics, and the history of science.

By exploring time in several contexts, we will examine the construct of time and what it means to travel through it. Through thinking about time travel we will necessarily reflect on a variety of related topics including the nature of time, the role of metaphor in scientific understanding, and such speculative topics as parallel universes, the origin of the universe, wormholes, and infinity. What defines a clock, and how does the concept of time differ from its measurement? Students will write several essays reflecting on these fields and questions and will also take on a research project that will involve studying research methodologies in the humanities and the sciences. Course readings will be taken from the fields of philosophy (Aristotle, Augustine, Bergson), physics (Einstein, Penrose, Smolin, Hawking), the history of science (Galison, Gleick), literature (Wells, Proust, Woolf, Heinlein, Asimov), and popular culture (Doctor Who, Harry Potter, The Terminator).","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:22:24.011Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:22:24.011Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede82320bd11405a8225ff","name":"First-Year Research Seminar: Music Journalism","location":"Bldg: ARC  Rm: LL03 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"TuTh 4:55PM - 6:10PM","course_number":20118,"department":"[object Promise] (First Year program)","description":"Effective music writing – criticism or reporting that places a song or album within the appropriate social, political, personal, and aesthetic contexts – can be as enthralling and moving as the music it engages.

We’ll consider the evolving tradition of pop music criticism (how is the critic’s role changing?) and the mysterious practice of translating sound into ideas (how do we train ourselves to be better and more thoughtful listeners?). Through reading, writing, workshop, and extensive class discussion, we’ll contemplate the mysterious circuitry that causes people to embrace or require pop music – from Bob Dylan to Travis Scott – and how best to explore that connection on the page.

Snow delivered a lecture in which he decried a growing separation between the humanities and the sciences. In it, he argued that two intellectual “cultures” were developing, both of whose practitioners were increasingly incapable of engaging each other. Today, the notion of a divide between “the humanities” and “the sciences,” or, as some term them, “the arts” and “the sciences,” is rather commonplace. We often hear people self-identify as “more left brain,” for example, or “not a math person.” In this course, we will explore how and why different people have found it useful to distinguish the arts and the sciences. We will also consider why others have found it useful to blur the arts and the sciences. Participants will begin by reading and contextualizing Snow’s original lecture, after which we will trace both the historical origins of the key concepts involved as well as how their meanings have changed over time from early modernity to today. (Mathematics, for example, was deemed an “art” for much of European history.) Having done so, we will then consider contemporary assessments. All told, in their research and in their writing, participants will be asked to examine how different people have sought to distinguish, reconcile, or even move beyond the “two cultures.” Readings for the course may include works by: Francis Bacon, Lisa Jardine, Marwa Elshakry, Paul Kristeller, Yuval Levin, and Rueylin Chen.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:22:35.076Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:22:35.076Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede82e20bd11405a822602","name":"First-Year Research Seminar: Black Experiences in Literature, Movies, and Television","location":"Bldg: 7E12  Rm: 125 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"MoWe 12:30PM - 1:45PM","course_number":22358,"department":"[object Promise] (First Year program)","description":"From the antebellum era to the Harlem Renaissance, Black people have turned to art, writing, and spirituals to make a statement about race relations, construct their racial identity, and (re)claim a sense of humanity under conditions of oppression. These artistic expressions are all the more significant and worthy of analysis in this era of mass media and in light of contemporary racial conflicts. This course will explore the pluralities and contradictions of black experiences as depicted in literature, movies, and television. It will take special interest in the work of Spike Lee, Toni Morrison, Tyler Perry, and Shonda Rhimes, all of whom delve into issues concerning race and captivate black audiences while doing so. We will use each artist to decipher what it means to be black; how this definition varies according to gender, class, age, and sexuality; and how depictions of blackness have changed over time. While many of the readings and media in this class are fiction, we will approach them from a sociological and humanistic perspective—that is, mining them for clues on how historical and social conditions (e.g., Jim Crow, mass incarceration, gentrification) shape the possibilities and limits of black experiences. And we will probe how different media permit artists to convey the lived experience and struggles of blacks in different, often more visceral, ways—and to different audiences—than conventional social science and nonfiction reporting.

Even more, we assume that work is intrinsic to our sense of identity and self-worth. Attached to modern understandings of work are implicit values and morals, specifically the work ethic that frames work as individualistic, merit-based, and belonging to the private sphere. However, recent political critiques have begun to (re) question the ways in which labor and spaces of work constitute (or exclude) us as social and political subjects. In this seminar we will consider work as not only connected and buttressed by the political sphere but as itself political. Our aim will be to examine the unquestioned values that inhere in our understanding of work as well the ways in which the organization of modern forms of work constitute us and organize us a political subjects. In doing so we will consider how labor relations produce and reproduce us as embodied and affective subjects that sustain or exclude different classes, genders, races and ages. We will begin by first examining classical understandings and critiques of the organization of work in the writings of John Locke, Adam Smith, Marx, and Max Weber. We will then turn to contemporary critiques of work including those that point to postwork imaginaries. What would it look and feel like to live in a postwork society? How would we reorganize our time? What creative projects might ensue? What conditions (a basic universal income?) would make such a society possible?

Senior projects deemed exceptional by the Gallatin Senior Project Committee will be awarded honors.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:23:14.503Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:23:14.503Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede85920bd11405a82260c","name":"Struggle for The Word: History of Media I","location":"Bldg:1Washington Pl Room:701 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"MoWe 11:00AM - 12:15PM","course_number":19958,"department":"[object Promise] (Interdisciplinary Seminars)","description":"The history of the media is the history of struggle, a battle waged over words and images: who produces them, who has access to them, whose interests are served by them, and how they are interpreted. Media power has traditionally been the province of elites, from Church and State to multinational communication conglomerates. But this is only one side of the story, for everyday people have also fought for their right to speak and be spoken to. Media has moved from the elite to the masses, in the process becoming \"democratized\"…but also often commodified.  Beginning with the printed word, and moving from the Bible through political pamphlet and popular song, the commercial penny press and immigrant newspapers, and ending with the web, this course will use the history of the printed word to explore enduring questions of power and culture. Texts will range from the Korean Sutra of the Great Incantations to the forced confessions of a barely literate sixteenth-century European miller; from Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson to Frederick Douglass; and from the literature and essays of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Ursula Le Guin to the historical and contemporary appeals of marketers and advertisers.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:23:21.696Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:23:21.696Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede85d20bd11405a82260d","name":"Poets in Protest: Footsteps to Hip Hop","location":"Bldg:1 Washington Pl  Room:401 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"We 6:20PM - 9:00PM","course_number":14004,"department":"[object Promise] (Interdisciplinary Seminars)","description":"This seminar examines the tradition of poetic protest in the African Diaspora.

Volumes of plays were written, theaters were built all over London, and each day, during the season, those theaters were filled with audiences from every social and economic class and gender, including foreigners from the rest of Europe, the Mediterranean basin and beyond. Theater was a craze. It was one of the key centers of cultural life in London. And in the center of this remarkably, vibrant creative world, Shakespeare was a superstar. We examine the city of London, Shakespeare, and theater from literary, historical, social, political and cultural perspectives. Our consideration of the theater is in relation to other forms of popular entertainment, such as singing, dancing and mountebank performances, and how they might have influenced Shakespeare. We read a selection of plays written by Shakespeare, that might include  As You Like It, Much Ado About Nothing, Richard III, Othello and Measure for Measure.

To answer these questions we examine how the colonial experience has given rise to value-laden linguistic practices that mirror and sustain the racializing of privilege; and how the experience of language-loss encountered by voluntary and involuntary migrants can attack the integrity of the self. While ultimately concerned with language, our discussions have a wide scope ranging from issues of political economy to collective consciousness and individual psychology.

Phaedrus, written later, develops Plato's ideas about the relation of the intellect, the emotions, and the appetites. Diderot's Rameau's Nephew revisits some of Plato's themes from the perspective of the eighteenth century and the changing world of the Enlightenment. Finally, we will explore dialogue form in the twentieth century through Virginia Woolf's novel Between the Acts and Tom Stoppard's play Arcadia.

Course readings include literary and other scholarly texts like Jamaica Kincaid’s A Small Place, Michel-Rolph Trouillot’s Silencing the Past and Michel De Certeau’s The Practice of Everyday Life as well as writings by Edward Said, William Cronon, Diana Taylor, Steven Hoelscher and Doreen Massey.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:24:33.329Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:24:33.329Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede8a420bd11405a822621","name":"Perversion","location":"Bldg:1Washington Pl  Room:527 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"We 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":19971,"department":"[object Promise] (Interdisciplinary Seminars)","description":"For Sigmund Freud, perversion denoted all sexual deviances from the  heterosexual and genital social norm, even as he acknowledged the  ubiquity of such perversions. For Jacques Lacan, perversion meant a  particular structure of desire, regardless of social norm, and was  related to an ethical dimension. For Michel Foucault, who thoroughly  rejected Freud’s “repressive hypothesis,” perversion was an effect of  modern sexuality. The course will pursue the following questions and  more: What is perversion? Is there a “cause” of perversion? Does it lie in  the individual or in the epistemological and ideological formulations of  a particular historical chronotope? This course will explore Freud,  Lacan and Foucault’s three contrasting notions of perversion, alongside  some feminist critiques of the psychoanalytic models, in relation to a  selection of Japanese fiction and film depicting a variety of  perversions.

This course explores this metaphor that proposes the making of beautiful, functional wholes out of fragments and scraps, using it to explore the cultural work of African American women and to illuminate connections between writers and artists. This rich intersection of writing and art allows us to consider broader questions about power; we investigate the ways in which the written works and textiles articulate, challenge and transform representations of race, gender, sexuality, as well as the meanings of art. This course takes us out into the city, where we view the textile creations of Black women artists like Faith Ringgold, Brenda Amina Robinson and Carrie Mae Weems at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim, the American Craft Museum, and the Museum of Folk Art. Written texts may include: Toni Morrison, The Bluest Eye; Gloria Naylor, Mama Day; Faith Ringgold, Tar Beach; Ntozake Shange, Sassafras, Cypress and Indigo.

This course has two principal aims: first, to help us to develop skills in the reading of lyric poetry, and, second, to consider the complex relation between lyric poetry and the actual world. In the first half of the class, we will study the forms and conventions of lyric poetry and work on developing our poetic sensibilities. In the second half, we will focus our attention on the relationship of modern poets to the concrete or actual world and focus our study on W.H. Auden and Wallace Stevens, two poets who address the pressing questions of their day, and the world they shared, in strikingly different ways. Yet, however different their approaches, both poets ponder questions of faith and secularity, consider heroism and loss in a century marked by war, and probe our human relationship to nature in answer to an increasingly industrialized and technological world.  Readings will include texts that consider how to read lyric poetry (Hirsch, Vendler, Perloff), a representative selection of modern lyric poetry (Eliot, Pound, Valéry, Éluard, Apollinaire, Moore, H.D., Bishop, Hughes, Brooks, Rich), the works of Auden and Stevens (essays and poems), as well as the philosophical, historical  and political narratives to which they refer and that inform their work (Freud, Nietzsche, William James, Santayana).","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:24:44.084Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:24:44.084Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede8af20bd11405a822624","name":"Media and Fashion","location":"Bldg:GCASL  Room:365 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"Fr 11:00AM - 1:45PM","course_number":19973,"department":"[object Promise] (Interdisciplinary Seminars)","description":"This course will examine the roles fashion plays in film, television and digital media and their cultural and economic significance. As a signifying system in its own right, fashion contributes to the semiotics of popular forms. It can also operate as a means of authentication (especially in period films and TV) or reveal a variety of ways in which media plays with space and time, purposeful or not. Besides evoking specific temporalities and narrative tone, fashion plays an important role in the construction of gender, both in terms of representation and address. This course will examine the history of the intersection of the fashion and media industries from the free distribution of film-related dress patterns in movie theaters of the 1910s to the current trend for make-over TV, networks like the Style network, the increasing proliferation of fashion blogs and the construction of specifically feminine video games. How does fashion’s specific configuration of consumerism, signification and visual pleasure lend itself to the articulation of modern/postmodern cultures and their presentation of the self? Texts will include Stella Bruzzi and Pamela Church Gibson, Fashion Cultures: Theories, Explanations and Analysis; selections from Roland Barthes, The Fashion System; Elizabeth Wilson, Adorned in Dreams: Fashion and Modernity; assorted articles and selected clips from films and television shows including Marie Antoinette, What Not To Wear, The New York Hat, Fashions of 1934, Now, Voyager and Sex and the City.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:24:47.569Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:24:47.569Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede8b320bd11405a822625","name":"Green Design from Geddes to Gore","location":"Bldg:GCASL  Room:265 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"Tu 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":14075,"department":"[object Promise] (Interdisciplinary Seminars)","description":"Students will explore the designers, cultures, and suppositions about the contemporary environmental movement.

The debate often revolves around whether the United States is guided by imperial self-interest, or lofty ideals. Because debates about U.S. imperialism since 9/11 have centered on interventions in seemingly distant places like Iraq and Afghanistan, Empire appears to denote a far-from-home phenomenon. Yet, the U.S. Empire is born out of and continues to depend upon interactions in the Americas. This course explores the premise that the U.S. Empire is an American Empire continuously redefined closer-to-home through contested borders, migrations, local politics and cultural practices, and inseparable from hemispheric experimentations with the meanings of freedom, democracy and development. It specifically addresses the following questions. How can Empire be understood as a category of analysis? What distinguishes an American Empire? How are U.S. imperial formations negotiated “at home?” In addition, the course foregrounds the U.S. relationship with Latin America in order to further question the meanings of home, America and Empire.

In this course we will read works from the canon of political theory alongside feminist critiques.

Nowhere is food more politically and culturally charged than in NYC, so the city is also our classroom. We negotiate the porous yet enduring boundaries of race and culture as often as we eat, walk or shop in Little Italy or Little India, Koreatown or Chinatown, Le Petite Senegal or Harlem. None of these places or cuisines is in any way associated with contemporary American food culture, which has historically harkened to preserving what is \"authentically\" American. These differences can be understood as forms of exclusion as well as cultural preservation—but either way they are lines of demarcation that make legible forms of power.

For example, the project of identifying affinities between women across cultures and national boundaries has long grounded the work of feminist movements, scholars, journalists, institutions and activists in a variety of locations, both within and outside the Euro-American context. More recently, struggles for the rights of sexual minorities have become increasingly transnational. We explore such efforts to forge enabling alliances and solidarities. We also critically examine how such efforts navigate cultural and national differences, hierarchies within a global world order and complex histories of imperialism, paying attention to the different locations through which such projects intersect with the global. The course highlights the rise of a new post-war international order centered in the UN system, exploring the links between colonial legacies and new global trajectories. How and why are women and girls, gender and sexuality so central to this system? By examining development initiatives that target women and girls, anti-violence and anti-trafficking campaigns, and the rights of sexual minorities, we explore how gender and sexuality become grounds for debating global, transnational and international visions and frameworks that, in turn, shape feminist and queer politics in different locales.

In part, this reflects a society in which identity seems increasingly malleable through greater social class mobility, the questioning of traditional gender roles, and imperialist opportunities. In these novels, fake identities conceal a murderer and a madwoman, among others. And the societal constraints inspiring the fictional secrets also led the authors to keep secrets of their own. Beloved author Charles Dickens, the father of 10, had a 13-year love affair with a woman who was 18 when they met. But does the novel genre, particularly the \"realist\" Victorian novel, with its emphasis on an omniscient narrator and intersecting plots, have a special relationship to secrets? We attempt to uncover the answer by studying Jane Eyre (1847) by Charlotte Bronte (1847), Great Expectations (1861), by Charles Dickens, George Eliot's Middlemarch (1871-2), and Arthur Conan Doyle's first Sherlock Holmes novel, A Study in Scarlet (1887).

Why does festivity sometimes lead to political revolt and at other times does not? Why does the \"carnivalesque\" often include festive abuse as well as celebration? We look at theories of festivity and release, at the dionysiac, at the human/animal union in festivity, and at the role of the classical period in shaping Renaissance and even modern ideas of festivity, irony and the festive worship of the gods. We also explore the effect of the Protestant suppression of festive holiday and theatricality in Shakespeare’s England, and at the tensions inherent in festivity between excess and moderation, between the saturnalia and the philosophical symposium. The class begins with classical festivity, with Plato's “Symposium,” Euripides' The Bacchae and the satyr play Cyclops, selections from Ovid's Fasti, the Metamorphoses, and Apuleius' Golden Ass. Readings from the Renaissance include: Rabelais, Gargantua and Pantagruel; Shakespeare, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, 1 Henry IV, Twelfth Night, Antony and Cleopatra, The Winter’s Tale. Concluding with carnival practices in the circum-Atlantic world, we take as examples the film Black Orpheus (Orfeu Negro, directed by Marcel Camus), New Orleans carnival and Jazz Funerals, and Paule Marshall’s novel The Chosen Place, the Timeless People (1969) in order to see how these older traditions shape modern experience.

Readings are drawn from Bourdieu’s Distinction, Glynn’s Tabloid Culture, Ross’ No Respect, and the anthology Trash Culture, while screenings include cult films such as Freaks, Pink Flamingos, Plan 9 From Outer Space,South Park, and The Room, and a selection of reality TV programs, music and viral videos.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:25:37.608Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:25:37.608Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede8e520bd11405a822633","name":"James Joyce and Interdisciplinary Modernism","location":"Bldg:1Washington Pl Room:701 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"Th 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":19982,"department":"[object Promise] (Interdisciplinary Seminars)","description":"\n\nThis course includes travel to Dublin, Ireland during the week of Spring Recess, March 15-22.

Drawing on painting, landscape architecture, psychoanalysis, philosophy, lyric and epic poetry, film and installation art, this class will explore the entanglement of nature and history and of the recent and deep past in representations of architectural and social decay—in the art and literature of ruined cottages, \"picturesque\" abbeys and castles, partially buried woodsheds. We will examine representations of objects redeemed from the ruins of history as well as the ruined sites in which such objects find refuge (arcades, museums, libraries).

This course surveys some of the most contentious debates on music’s past, present, and future waged between music theorists, critics, artists, and audiences, spanning the last five hundred years. Our focus is on the seemingly inevitable tension between what music is, what it should be, and what it can be. Starting with the Greek philosophers of antiquity, we explore debates on the musicof Claudio Monteverdi, Ludwig van Beethoven, Richard Wagner, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, John Cage, Bob Dylan, and The Slits. We also examine the backlash against and subsequent defense of styles like jazz, rock and roll, punk rock, and rap. Our goal is to better understand how culture is “made” ​precisely ​during ​these ​moments of charged debate, where a particular music’s perceived merits​ or transgressions serve as the pretext for larger ​often controversial ideological issues. Art, in this sense, becomes a platform by which to observe how competing aesthetic value​ systems​ reveal deep social and cultural rifts. This class meets twice a week. Our first session is devoted to scrutinizing and discussing primary sources​:​ letters, newspaper and magazine articles, journal entries, sound recordings, and film. For our second session we read and discuss secondary sources by scholars, critics, and investigative journalists for context, using this new information as a way to think critically about the primary sources and our own aesthetic judgments.Debating music tradition and innovation, as we shall see, is a long-standing tradition in its own right.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:25:55.388Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:25:55.388Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede8f720bd11405a822638","name":"Arab Cinema(s)","location":"Bldg:1 Washington Pl  Room:501 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"We 6:20PM - 9:45PM","course_number":14030,"department":"[object Promise] (Interdisciplinary Seminars)","description":"The Arab world is a vast region encompassing vibrant societies and dynamic cultures, but its geopolitical importance and a resilient Orientalism often reduce it to Hollywoodish stereotypes and misrepresentations.

We will begin by briefly examining the introduction of the medium in colonial times and trace its development both as an industry as well as an art form through the national era all the way to the neoliberal present. We will view and critically examine a number of selected films that represent the diversity of the region, but also the shared concerns and common sociopolitical struggles and challenges facing its societies. We will focus on key moments, both aesthetically and politically, and will explore how filmmakers negotiate and represent the following: anti-colonialism and liberation, nationalism and national identity, gender and sexuality, communal strife and civil wars, class struggle and social justice, globalization and neoliberalism, and the recent revolts.

In 1965, his controversial sculpture entitled Western and Christian Civilization, which depicted Christ crucified on a two-meter-long model of a U.S. Vietnam-era bomber, elicited both accolades and shock.During decades of national and international tension, Ferrari's art spurred controversy for the way it critiqued linguistic and cultural convention; sexual repression; anti-Semitism, misogyny, and homophobia; military dictatorship; religion and colonialism; and Latin American megacities. At the same time, he explored paths toward liberation, the potential of mass media and the revolutionary potential of making-- and not making-- art. Is it any wonder that his 2004-2005 Buenos Aires retrospective was vandalized? A judge closed the show, but others mobilized in its favor, thereby demonstrating the unsettled business of culture and politics in a country one historian has called \"the Extreme West.\" In this seminar Ferrari's career will be a springboard to examine a number of crosscutting issues, in particular cultural inheritance and global modernism; artistic, individual, and national sovereignty; censorship and vandalism; and differing notions of civilization. Such questions will lead us to look across media and disciplines toward architecture and urbanism, film and cartoons; as well as philosophy, political theory, history, and literature.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:26:20.100Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:26:20.100Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede90f20bd11405a82263f","name":"Library and Laboratory: Trans-Atlantic Histories of Early Modern Science","location":"Bldg:194M  Room:205 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"Fr 12:30PM - 3:15PM","course_number":19990,"department":"[object Promise] (Interdisciplinary Seminars)","description":"The term “science” stems from the Latin word “scientia,” which means knowledge and skill.

We will investigate the connectivity of intellectual space and physical research in early modern knowledge production, asking how book collecting, note-taking, and experimental practices contributed to the production of scientific knowledge.

We will examine how literature and other cultural productions such as prints, paintings, advertisements, and photographs depict this commercial phenomenon as a “phantasmagorical space” in which stereotypical notions of female desire are disseminated, and ideas of social mobility and scientific progress are advanced.We will also explore how contemporary display strategies of the grands magasins, or “cathedrals of commerce,” helped create a new consumer culture of “commodity aesthetics” based on spectacle, artifice, and pleasure.

The feeling must be aired.” In this course we will consider both the joking and serious import of Wiley’s provocative (but not unproblematic) assertion by drawing on a theoretical framework provided to us by affect studies. Several carefully chosen case studies in black peoples’ shouting draw our attention to the role that “catching feelings” often plays in creating and sustaining notions of community, protest and resistant politics. Readings on a variety of subjects—ring shouts and race riots, black power protests and protest novels, spoken word poetry and prophetic hip hop, the Black Arts movement and Black Lives Matter—are designed to fuel thoughtful and exploratory discussions whose references run the gamut from church ladies hollering “Hallelujah” to Chester Himes’s If He Hollers Let Him Go, to Marvin Gaye’s “Inner City Blues (Makes Me Wanna Holler)” and Tupac Shakur’s “Holler If Ya Hear Me.” In each instance, we will attempt to uncover specific spiritual, political, psychological and aesthetic motives for (or effects of) airing inside feelings in public spaces.

Officials devised thus strategies to transform people’s sartorial aspirations and daily practices, the consequences of which extend to the post-Soviet present. Beginning with an introduction to material culture and fashion studies, the course proceeds to an examination of the ways in which state socialist regimes manipulated fashion to legitimize their power, followed by an examination of the sartorial practices citizens developed to assimilate, adapt, and resist domination.

Although these texts are very different from one another – they include a radically materialist philosophical poem, a mythological counter-epic, a picaresque novel whose narrator is magically turned into a donkey, and an autobiographical profession of Christian faith – they share a deep concern with the nature of personal identity and its relationship to writing. Over the course of the semester, we will track these common interests, while also situating each of our texts in its particular historical, social, and intellectual contexts; we will also want to consider the ways in which Latin literature’s persistent concern with transformation reflects the distinctive hybridity of Roman culture.

The semester will culminate with the online publication of transnational, collaborative projects that explore what the art and writing of city streets reveals about urban life in 21st century America.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:27:45.491Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:27:45.491Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede96420bd11405a822657","name":"(De)Tangling the Business of Black Women's Hair","location":"Bldg: 7E12  Rm: 124 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"MoWe 11:00AM - 12:15PM","course_number":20002,"department":"[object Promise] (Interdisciplinary Seminars)","description":"For many black women, their understanding of their race, gender, class and identity and notions of beauty are linked to hair.Divided into three sections, this course will first seek to understand the historical, structural, and economic dimensions of black women’s hair.

As a crucial part of this project, we will explore alternatives to these narratives. Most of us educated in the “West” (and many of its former or current colonies) have been taught that the era beginning with Columbus and extending for the next two centuries, has been marked by the agency of “Europeans” whose discoveries led to globalization and modernity. Two not often asked questions in courses on this era will motivate our discussions: what kinds of travel, knowledge production, and artistic creation were people throughout the world involved in at the time of these well studied events and why are these other events excluded from the dominant narrative we are taught? Some additional questions include: in what ways did “European” “adventures,” knowledge production and accumulation of profits derive from, or depend on, other regions and to what extent can they be considered collaborative? What impact—socially, economically, and environmentally--did the events of this age have both on the peoples and places that were colonized and enslaved and on our contemporary world? To explore how our understanding of the \"Age of Discovery\" impacts what counts today as “modern,” vs. “underdeveloped” or “backwards,” we will study works that place our contemporary world in conversation with the “early modern.” Materials for this course—written, visual, and oral-- will be wide ranging and, at times, innovative in both genre and discipline.

The declaration insists on the contradiction at the heart of the notion of the free and rights-bearing ‘human’ that was being heralded on both sides of the Black Atlantic in what some described as ‘the age of liberty’. This class will take up Toussaint's question and focus on notions of the human that emerge in international law’s imbrication with racial capitalism in the 'early-modern' Atlantic world. Using key moments in the history of international law to anchor our conversation, we will probe the contours of the global order that unfolds through the legal architecture of colonialism, slavery and trade.

His thought experiments are often thought of as day dreams involving falling elevators and clocks in space, but in fact can be drawn on graph-like diagrams that allow physicists to understand and experiment with Einstein’s theory. However, physicists are often unable to construct any visual representation and must resort to heuristic or artistic pictures that tell a convincing story, and not a graphical translation, of the underlying math. How, for example, does one draw 10-dimensions? Does the black hole in the film Interstellar really look like that? What is at stake when our ability to \"picture\" space-time is insufficient at best and, at worst, completely wrong? The aim of this course will be to understand the relationship between the theories of space-time and its various representations—narrative, pictorial, and diagrammatic—as well as to use these representations to solve real problems in physics. In addition to readings and class discussion, this course will involve a large amount of physics, which depends on understanding and manipulating equations, which will depend on High School math that we will review to get everyone up to speed.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:28:14.368Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:28:14.368Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede98120bd11405a82265f","name":"Photographing Peace","location":"Bldg:1 Washington Pl  Room:432 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"Tu 2:00PM - 4:45PM","course_number":20099,"department":"[object Promise] (Interdisciplinary Seminars)","description":"This seminar asks, “What does peace look like?”What are the visual narratives of post-conflict societies, and how do they conform to or complicate our generalized notions and expectations around what “peace” means?

We interrogate how different ethnic, linguistic, religious, and social groups in a borderless world gave and took ideas, beliefs, and practices, making the oceanscape an arena of conflict and community. How did world religions, like Buddhism and Islam, and political forms, like empires and maritime city-states, integrate the seas into social, economic, and political life?

How do migrants document their own narratives as they cross, re-cross, and contest borders?

To anchor the global trend, this course traces the condition of the body under forced transit in the context of contemporary Middle East and North Africa. Looking at the exile literature from Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Libya, among other countries, together we look at how exile is embodied, experienced and articulated. In doing so, we pay close attention to two crucial themes. First, we explore how first-hand accounts of displacement navigate and respond to the tropes of representations of Middle Eastern migrants, especially Muslims and/or Arabs in the West. Second, we look at how migration to (often) Western countries enriches, enables or debilitate one’s notion of social commitment. What forms of social and political engagement is shaped through exile?

What is Sufi poetics, and with what conceptual tools do we explore its multiple layers? Ultimately, what is love in the Sufi imaginary? The course will enable students to reflect on non-Western philosophies and histories of Islam, while introducing them to Sufi poetry from a variety of languages including Persian, Arabic, Sindhi, and Punjabi. Course themes include histories of Sufi saints in South Asia, the body, ritual and symbols in Sufi praxis, visual cultures in Sufi lifeworlds, gender and power in poetic thought, and love and spiritual subjectivity as modes of resistance. Key texts include the scholarly works of Annemarie Schimmel and Shahzad Bashir, translated poetic works of Rumi, Hafez, Shah Latif Bhitai, Rabia Basri, and Bulleh Shah, and a range of sonic and visual archives - artwork, songs, and documentaries that illuminate the themes of the class beyond text.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:28:49.799Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:28:49.799Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede9a520bd11405a822669","name":"Climate Change","location":"Bldg:1 Washington Pl  Room:432 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"Th 9:30AM - 12:15PM","course_number":24218,"department":"[object Promise] (Interdisciplinary Seminars)","description":"Is anxiety about the climate crisis warranted? As protests rock London, New York and other cities around the world, what does an interdisciplinary view bring to these public debates? This course draws on theories from science studies, decolonial theory, anthropology and climate justice to tease apart a multifaceted - and multicultural - view of our collective ecological predicament. First we take on the political side of climate change by asking questions about its collective nature. How do we think about political collectivity? Then we turn to a critical understanding of the science, both to expose ourselves to some of the underlying facts and to think about science as a socio-political process. Lastly we focus on 'Living with Climate Change' - human practices ranging from fossil fuel cultures and the sociology of protest, to pragmatic attempts to grapple with a rapidly changing climate around the world. We read works from Pope Francis and Montaigne to Donna Haraway and Slavoj Zizek. Far from instilling a predetermined viewpoint, this seminar is designed to impart critical thinking skills for a rapidly evolving global situation.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:28:53.248Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:28:53.248Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dede9a820bd11405a82266a","name":"Practicum in Fashion Business","location":"Bldg:1Washington Pl  Room:801 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Gallatin - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"We 2:30PM - 5:15PM","course_number":13808,"department":"[object Promise] (Practicum)","description":"The fashion industry’s need to navigate the increasingly complex demands of globalization requires a creative, hands-on approach.

Community building, family well-being, early childhood education, health, juvenile justice reform, service integration and child welfare are featured in readings, discussion, and internships. Through examples such as ethnic-matching placements in foster care, zero-tolerance approaches to drug abuse, or public financing of political campaigns, students come to understand how government, schools, gangs, religious institutions and families can, with varying degrees of explicitness and formality, all make policy. Students at the course conclusion are able to: identify policies within their lives; argue all sides of a policy question; appreciate the importance of qualitative and quantitative evidence; and distinguish implementation from formulation. Readings include Bowling Alone, by Robert Putnam, The Lost Children of Wilder, by Nina Bernstein; The Oath and the Office; by Corey Brettschneider (Donated Copies) and Not a Crime to Be Poor by Peter Edelman . Students will be helped to connect meetings they attend and the policy concepts taught and discussed in class. The goal is to leave no student unaware of the importance of policy in their own and their community's life. Policies that are empowering are emphasized, techniques doe for oral and written advocacy, persuasion and attitude change are embedded in a final project that requires using existing skills and talents and learning new ones.

Interrogating early Modern notions of finance by asking how they intersected with, shaped, and were shaped by categories of race and gender will garner new understandings of these interrelated processes.  Late medieval and early modern modes of accounting cohered around notions of enslavability, and the hereditary mark of race became embedded in how gender produced categories of freedom and slavery—all of which are crucial to the study of economy and race in the Atlantic world.  This seminar will explore those intersections between histories of race, gender, and finance that culminate in early modern Atlantic slavery.

This course examines the social and political life of media and how it makes a difference in the daily lives of people as a practice – in production, reception, or circulation. It examines cross-culturally how the mass media have become the primary means for the circulation of symbolic forms across time and space and crucial to the constitution of subjectivities, collectivities, and histories in the contemporary world.  Topics include the role of media in constituting and contesting national identities, in forging alternative political visions, in transforming religious practice, and in creating subcultures.

At the same time, the discipline of anthropology is itself an historical and sociocultural product.  In this sense, historicizing the discipline is – or should be – similar to treating anthropology itself anthropologically, as produced historically and within a cultural framework itself.\nThis course surveys these issues as they relate to the development of method and theory within the context of the discipline’s institutional and cultural locations. The broad frame concerns anthropology as itself an anthropological (or historical) problem, especially its concern with the problem of similarity and difference in human populations, its involvements in the management of difference, and the politics of representation, but also the different institutional loci of practice.  Within this frame, we will concern ourselves with the particularities of different kinds of explanatory paradigms and their deployments.  The class will consider both the formal qualities and rigor of different paradigms -- that is, their anthropological potential, as well as their embeddedness in histories.  Focuses on French, British, and American anthropology and how they contributed to the development of the modern discipline.\n \nPrerequisites:  Anthropology background or permission of instructor.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:31:05.969Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:31:05.969Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedea2d20bd11405a82268f","name":"New Directions in LatinX Studies","location":"20 Cooper Sq Rm 485 Conference Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":24167,"department":"[object Promise] (Anthropology)","description":"This seminar examines the growth and development of Latinx Studies from the 1960s onwards and reflects on its potential and future in the U.S. academy.

This course starts by considering the beginnings of documentary in literature, film, and the visual arts, from the controversial coining of the term in 1926. We will explore representative works from foundational moments in the evolution of documentary—the beginnings of the newsreel, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression era documentary books, the cinéma-vérité movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films, poetry, and archival art. How has the emergence of this new term and its development affected our other key concepts—document and fiction? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies—print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, “fiction in the archives,” false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. Critical and theoretical readings by Paula Amad, Eric Barnouw, Roland Barthes, Stella Bruzzi, Jane Gaines, Carlo Ginzburg, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Barbara Johnson, Bill Nichols, Philip Rosen, Vivian Sobchack, Gayatri Spivak, Susan Sontag, Edward Said, Alan Sekula, Sven Spieker, Ann Stoler, Diana Taylor, and others.

Luxury — routinely portrayed as a feminine vice and often bringing together the violence of nation with the violence of empire (as in the quotation above) — was the object of lively eighteenth-century debates. This course examines these debates in the rich context that produced them; we will read widely across eighteenth-century literature and philosophy, first placing accounts that portray luxury as offering a “publick benefit” alongside satires lampooning the corrupting effects of luxury; second contextualizing our study with works grappling with the birth of aesthetics and the philosophy of taste; and finally, considering how the apparent democracy of luxury conceals a story about the fate of the aristocracy. Our eighteenth-century readings will also lead us to examine accounts of affluence, excess, and aristocracy in twentieth-century sociology, from Weber to Veblen and Tarde.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:43:53.391Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:43:53.391Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deded2d20bd11405a822761","name":"Comparative Approaches to the Literatures of Africa, the Middle East, Global South","location":"Bldg:194M  Room:202 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":3520,"department":"[object Promise] (Comparative Literature)","description":"\n\nThe aim of this seminar is to introduce students to recent exciting developments in Comparative Literature, in which the discipline is harnessing the energies of Area Studies (Middle Eastern Studies, African Studies, Slavic and East Asian Studies, and so forth) in order to extend its scope geographically, and deepen its learning, for example through the study of languages and literatures beyond those European tongues that, traditionally, have formed the core of Comparative Literature. At the same time, because of the way in which nomenclature relating to “Areas” is evolving, an allied aim is to introduce students to the idea of the “Global South,” a successor to “Third World” and “Developing World” in its broader contemporary use, which Comparative Literature scholars, in their anti-Eurocentric endeavor, are increasingly finding compelling.

Realism was defined oppositionally:  as prose, not poetry; as the profane, not the sacred; and the vernacular or popular, not the language of learning and authority.  The seminar will interpret primary texts and images produced mainly in the German-speaking lands between about 1400 and 1700, including:   saints’ legends, profane legends, vernacular retellings of the Gospel, fables and proverbs, textual and pictorial propaganda of the Protestant Reformation, the realism in the art of Albrecht Dürer and other artists of the period; fictional texts by Hans Sachs, Johann Fischart, and H. J. Ch. von Grimmelshausen; and Schwank or comic literature including Till Eulenspiegel.   More broadly the seminar will address the representation of domesticity, labor, and leisure; portraiture; anecdote and story-telling; “popular culture,” “folklore,” and “folk art”; satire and parody as secularizing forces; exoteric vs. esoteric religion; the boundary between sacred and profane; early genre paintings and prints; autobiography, ego-documents, conversion narratives; the prehistory and form of the novel; proverbs, Kalendergeschichten, novellas; fairy tales, local myths and legends; and vernacular retellings of historical and pagan tales.  The historical material will be framed by critical and theoretical texts of the nineteenth and twentieth century, including Hegel, Nietzsche, Bakhtin, Shklovsky, Auerbach, Benjamin, Jolles, Jameson, Rancière.  Although the primary focus will be on German material, the course will attempt to accommodate students with interests and language-skills in other European traditions.  The visual arts will also be a constant point of reference. Conducted in English.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:18.772Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:18.772Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deded4620bd11405a822768","name":"Topics:","location":"Bldg:721Broadway  Room:670 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Th 12:30PM - 4:30PM","course_number":21863,"department":"[object Promise] (Comparative Literature)","description":"\n\nFoucault's Collège de France lectures I\n\nIn 1969, Michel Foucault took up a position as professor of the \"History of Systems of Thought\" at France's very prestigious Collège de France where one requirement of the appointment was an annual set of lectures open to the public. Over the next 14 years (one off for sabbatical), Foucault gave lectures that sometimes complemented his published books but sometimes took off in other directions. Topics included: the violence of exclusion in systems of thought, the nature of truth-telling in modern culture, the rise of juridical society, the politics of war, governance of populations, the emergence of companionate marriage, the history of neoliberalism, dominant society's relation to those it deems abnormal, and so on. This 2-semester course (Part 1 is not required for registration in Part 2) seeks to approach Foucault through the Collège de France lectures combined with his canonic published texts. In alternate weeks, we will study a lecture-series and key publications with the goal of gaining an overall picture of the contributions of Michel Foucault to contemporary thought.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:22.690Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:22.690Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deded4a20bd11405a822769","name":"Topics:","location":"Bldg:SILV  Room:509 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Th 12:30PM - 3:10PM","course_number":21864,"department":"[object Promise] (Comparative Literature)","description":"\n\nMaking an Entrance and Taking the Stage: Protocols of Drama, Film, and Politics\n\nThe seminar explores forms and protocols of making an entrance in past and present. It focuses on the theatrical structure of the moment of appearing and describes the rhetorical devices that create presence on stage. Likewise, it names the disturbances that make this presence precarious. „Entrances“ shall thus be approached from a dual perspective: as energetical instances of triumph and impetus but also as moments of tragic or comic failure. In a first step, we will discuss the political and military protocol of triumph in imperial Rome as a highly influential ceremonial procedure and analyze its formal components. We will then investigate the articulation of entrances in drama concentrating on examples from Aischylos, Shakespeare and French classicism that oscillate between triumph and tragic crisis. Finally, we will trace the art of making an entrance as well as its counter-forces in examples from politics, film and drama of the 20th and 21st centuries. The seminar analyzes how film challenges theatrical entrances, how modern drama minimizes and subverts the act of appearing but also how politics revive the tradition of triumph and its protocols. Materials to be studied include Aischylos's Agamemnon; Shakespeare's Macbeth; Racine's Phedra; Beckett's Waiting for Godot and Breath; films by John Ford and Ernst Lubitsch (among others).

During the course of the eighteenth century, through a complex process, the subject of the sovereign becomes himself the sovereign. Before asking the equally important question, then, after Jean-Luc Nancy and others—“Who Comes After the Subject?”—we will try to come to terms with this momentous transformation and its consequences for politics and art. The effects of this transformation become legible in nineteenth-century West Asia through the Ottoman reform movement, the Tanzimat, and the Arab awakening, the Nahda. In this seminar, we will explore these transformations through their reflections in Ottoman-Arab and -Turkish letters through the writings of al-Jabarti, al-Tahtawi, Namık Kemal, al-Shidyaq, al-Muwaylihi, Zaydan, Fatma Aliye, May Ziyadeh and others. The historical and conceptual background of these transformations will be reconstructed through Hobbes, Rousseau, Benjamin, Auerbach, Kantorowicz, Foucault, Balibar, Agamben, Derrida, Kamuf, Apter, and Malabou, among others. The connection between, even the possible conflation of aesthetics and politics will be approached specifically through Bataille’s repeated, if also somewhat oblique, references to “the sovereign man of art” and to “the last man” and to his“inner experience.”","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:29.901Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:29.901Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deded5120bd11405a82276b","name":"Individual Research","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2471,"department":"[object Promise] (Comparative Literature)","description":"\n\nPERMISSION REQUIRED FOR SECTION 001.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:33.314Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:33.314Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deded5420bd11405a82276c","name":"Individual Research","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":3116,"department":"[object Promise] (Comparative Literature)","description":"null","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:36.728Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:36.728Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deded5820bd11405a82276d","name":"Academic Internship","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2920,"department":"[object Promise] (Comparative Literature)","description":"null","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:40.183Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:40.183Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deded5b20bd11405a82276e","name":"Tpcs in Renaissance Lit","location":"Casa Italiana, Rm 203 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":21283,"department":"[object Promise] (Comparative Literature)","description":"\n\nFlorentine Culture in Context, 1250-1600\n\nThis course offers the opportunity to study some of the key works of late-medieval and Renaissance Florentine literary, intellectual and artistic culture in their social and political contexts, and hence to engage diachronically with the broader theoretical question of the ways in which elite culture is inflected by socioeconomic and political developments. The choice of texts to be studied has been calculated to provide both a sense of the diversity of Florentine culture and its continuities. Besides texts that conventionally fall under the rubric of literature, such as lyric poetry, verse narrative, and drama, the syllabus encompasses chronicles, sermons, and works of political, rhetorical, social, and aesthetic theory.

The French translation of Boileau (1674) starts the fortune of the treatise and its dissemination through Europe between the 18th and the 20th centuries. Rather than concentrating on the fortune of the sublime, most recent studies have focused on the origin of this idea by showing that its roots are part of the ancient Greek and Latin Culture, and that although the word itself was not used before the first century BC, the concept existed long before. A basic assumption is that the pseudo Longinus treatise, dated between the second and third century, was not an original work and that it was a product of the Platonism of the time.\nThe course considers the sources of the sublime in the Greek and Latin rhetoric of grand style. It evaluates the importance of this notion in the biblical theological tradition, as well as in the Neoplatonic and Neoplatonic Christian authors such as Plotinus, the pseudo Dionysius, Augustine, Gregory the Great, Richard of Saint Victor, and others.\nClasses will be devoted to reading and discussing texts in the vernacular Italian tradition in both prose and poetry, tracing the making of this idea and its evolution from the first lyric poetry of the 13th century to authors such as Dante, Petrarch, the Platonic school of Florence, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Vittoria Colonna, Galileo, Vico, Leopardi, and Montale.  In this perspective, the course also offers a kind of introduction to the theory of the sublime, as it develops from the 16th century to today, as in the work of Burke, Vico, Kant, Hegel, and Lyotard.\n\nThe course will be given in English.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:50.665Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:50.665Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deded6620bd11405a822771","name":"Topic Lit Contemp/Cult:","location":"Deutches Haus, Auditorium Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 2:00PM - 4:40PM","course_number":21286,"department":"[object Promise] (Comparative Literature)","description":"\n\nMarx: Romanticism, Capital, Media\n\nMarx’s writing is positioned between German Idealism and Romanticism, political economy in its classical and neoclassical forms, and the problem of machines.

Adorno, Stuart Hall, Jean Baudrillard, Hans Magnus Enzensberger, Donna Haraway). By focusing on the Idealist/Romanticist underpinnings of Marx’s concept of value, we will be able to track the evolution of the value/capital complex from classicism to neoclassicism. Marx’s long chapters on the machinery question also lay the groundwork for understanding the rise of digital capitalism and neoliberalism (alongside readings from Jodi Dean, Sianne Ngai, and Tiziana Terranova).

Why did Leopardi turn to the Greek\npoetess Sappho to voice his own concerns about the miserable state of human beings? What\ndid Sappho’s tragic fate tell Leopardi about the role of poetry in human life? While these\nquestions are not easy to answer, the poet’s treatment of Sappho provides us with a most\nfruitful lens through which to look at the complex ways in which the poetical culture of Italy\ndeveloped in the decades around 1800, hanging in the balance between concurrent (and, to\nsome extent, conflicting) trends: indeed, Leopardi’s Sappho captures the tension between the\npermanence of “classicist” poetical forms and the circulation of “romantic” motifs that\ncharacterized the peculiar way in which Italy received and responded to European\nRomanticism. In fact, Leopardi’s poem is part of a rich series of texts that, in conjunction\nwith the modern rediscovery of Sappho’s poetry, contributed to trigger a veritable “Sappho\nfever” throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. By exploring significant\ninstallments of Sappho’s afterlife in the period, this seminar aims to introduce students to the\n“classicist” roots of Italian Romanticism by studying two interrelated topics: namely, the\nstatus of the poetess’s voice vis-à-vis the poetical uses of her myth; and the relevance of such\nuses to broader questions about the reception of antiquity within the poetical culture of Italian\nRomanticism.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:57.721Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T06:44:57.721Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5deded6d20bd11405a822773","name":"Thesis Research","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2472,"department":"[object Promise] (Comparative Literature)","description":"\n\nPERMISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRED.

Some of the period's most   characteristic products were born out of the conviction that concepts could be systematically turned into images — and that such images could be organized into a visual language, more profound and universal than discursive logic. Egyptian hieroglyphs and dream visions, in their graphic exuberance, were considered typical vehicles of this advanced mode of communication. The desire to emulate their symbolic density is reflected both in literature and in art, often in ways that challenge common distinctions between visual and verbal communication. In this course you will be introduced to an assortment of works representative of such interplay between text and image: emblem books, dream books and dream-centered works, hieroglyphic inventions and studies, collections of proverbs, iconology manuals, etc. Among the books examined are some widely considered as the finest examples of design in the history of printing. Early modern and recent theory of emblems will also be discussed. As a present-day counterpart of Renaissance emblems, the course will conclude with a survey of corporate logos and Russian criminal tattoos.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:11.408Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:11.408Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf17720bd11405a82288a","name":"Topics:","location":"Casa Italiana, Rm 203 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":20721,"department":"[object Promise] (European and Mediterranean Stu)","description":"\n\nSame as ITAL-GA 2155 The Sublime: History and Geography of a Rhetorical, Aesthetic and Ethical Idea","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:15.255Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:15.255Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf17b20bd11405a82288b","name":"Grad Sem Europ Studies","location":"King Juan Carlos, Rm 324 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Th 2:00PM - 4:00PM","course_number":2544,"department":"[object Promise] (European and Mediterranean Stu)","description":"\n\nRequired for CEMS MA students.

Which expressions of religious identity are permitted in public space or reflected in the urban landscape, which are marked as problematic, and why? What principles do courts invoke to support restrictions on religious practice, and what conceptions of religion does this privilege? To examine the complex ways in which law and religion intersect in contemporary Europe, this course integrates anthropological approaches to studying law and culture, including studies of secularism, with geographical approaches to studying space and power. Through a range of case studies from across Europe, we consider how the legal regulation of religion may intersect with other categories such as gender, race, sexuality and ethnicity, and examine the assumptions and impacts of legal doctrines delineating “public” and “private” spheres. We also explore how the regulation of religious practices impacts citizenship and rights for minority members, such as through the regulation of clothing, bodily conduct, places of worship or urban \"soundscapes\" (e.g. in debates on regulating public prayer calls). To understand the stakes and limits of state efforts to regulate religion, we analyze these dynamics at local, municipal, national, and regional scales, including European-level human rights frameworks, and consider how notions such as religious freedom are invoked in policymaking at the international scale. While the course focuses on contemporary debates on religion and law in Europe, it will also analyze selected U.S and global case studies to highlight diverse policy approaches and their consequences.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:22.645Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:22.645Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf18220bd11405a82288d","name":"Eastern Europe Workshop","location":"King Juan Carlos, Rm 324 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":2,"time":"We 12:30PM - 2:00PM","course_number":2864,"department":"[object Promise] (European and Mediterranean Stu)","description":"null","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:26.462Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:26.462Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf18620bd11405a82288e","name":"Independent Study","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2545,"department":"[object Promise] (European and Mediterranean Stu)","description":"null","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:30.048Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:30.048Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf18920bd11405a82288f","name":"Independent Study","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2546,"department":"[object Promise] (European and Mediterranean Stu)","description":"null","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:33.582Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:33.582Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf18d20bd11405a822890","name":"Independent Study","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2547,"department":"[object Promise] (European and Mediterranean Stu)","description":"null","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:37.282Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:37.282Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf19120bd11405a822891","name":"Topics:","location":"King Juan Carlos, Rm 324 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Fr 10:00AM - 12:00PM","course_number":22014,"department":"[object Promise] (European and Mediterranean Stu)","description":"\n\nFull title: Sincerity and Authenticity in European Thought\n\nThe course will examine the emergence, in European thought, of the related ideals of sincerity and authenticity. We will investigate the ways in which they have shaped moral and political thought in Europe, particularly through their role in debates about identity, nationalism and multiculturalism. We will do so mainly through an examination of primary texts, ranging from political thought to novels and poetry. Alongside these we will also read some of the contemporary literature on the significance of authenticity as an ideal.\n\nEach week the class preparation will involve either an assigned reading and/or listening to a piece of music or watching a film (links will be provided for the latter two). Class will be discussion-based.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:41.160Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:02:41.160Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf19420bd11405a822892","name":"Topics:","location":"King Juan Carlos, Rm 324 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 2:00PM -

Nous partirons d’une question simple : quelle est la part de la nature (c’est-à-dire du monde physique) dans la construction d’un objet culturel qui s’appelle la « France » au moment où cet objet vient à exister dans les textes et dans les arts ? D’une part, nous prendrons appui sur des textes majeurs de l’époque pré-moderne (Du Bellay, Labé, Ronsard, Montaigne, Garnier, etc.), sur des études critiques récentes (Conley, Hampton, Mackenzie, etc.) et sur des écrits théoriques reconnus (Renan, Anderson, etc.) pour (re )tracer une histoire, celle de la participation de la langue, de la littérature et des arts à la construction d’une (idée de la) nation française. Les repères historiques sont nombreux : à partir de 1539, les actes de l’administration et de la justice doivent être rédigés « en langage maternel français et non autrement » ; de 1549 date la Deffense, et illustration de la langue françoyse de Du Bellay ; l’année 1594 voit la publication du premier atlas français (le Theatre françoys de Maurice Bouguereau), etc. D’autre part, nous mènerons une réflexion théorique, croisant les animal studies, la plant theory et l’éco-pensée, avec des penseurs contemporains (Irigaray, Serres, Latour, etc.) pour repenser cette histoire socio-culturelle en insistant sur le fait que l’idée de « nation » implique une certaine organisation (voire colonisation) du monde soi-disant « naturel » (c’est-à-dire physique). De ce point de vue, nous aurons donc à réfléchir sur la façon dont un fait culturel se construit en aménageant et en encadrant des faits naturels (par ex. la géographie physique, les corps humains et non humains, les plantes, etc.).","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:07:23.401Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:07:23.401Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf2ae20bd11405a8228e0","name":"Tpcs French Cult Hist:","location":"15 Washington Mews, Rm B03 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 12:30PM -

Taught by Berent Prof. Juliane Vogel. First meeting Feb 6.\nThe seminar explores forms and protocols of making an entrance in past and present. It focuses on the theatrical structure of the moment of appearing and describes the rhetorical devices that create presence on stage. Likewise, it names the disturbances that make this presence precarious. „Entrances“ shall thus be approached from a dual perspective: as energetical instances of triumph and impetus but also as moments of tragic or comic failure. In a first step, we will discuss the political and military protocol of triumph in imperial Rome as a highly influential ceremonial procedure and analyze its formal components. We will then investigate the articulation of entrances in drama concentrating on examples from Aischylos, Shakespeare and French classicism that oscillate between triumph and tragic crisis. Finally, we will trace the art of making an entrance as well as its counter-forces in examples from politics, film and drama of the 20th and 21st centuries. The seminar analyzes how film challenges theatrical entrances, how modern drama minimizes and subverts the act of appearing but also how politics revive the tradition of triumph and its protocols. Materials to be studied include Aischylos's Agamemnon; Shakespeare's Macbeth; Racine's Phedra; Beckett's Waiting for Godot and Breath; films by John Ford and Ernst Lubitsch (among others).","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:03.114Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:03.114Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf2d620bd11405a8228eb","name":"Marx Literary Criticism","location":"Deutches Haus, Auditorium Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 2:00PM - 4:40PM","course_number":20180,"department":"[object Promise] (German)","description":"\n\n\"Marx: Romanticism, Capital, Media.\" Conducted in English. Contact instructor for enrollment in GERM-GA1568.\nMarx’s writing is positioned between German Idealism and Romanticism, political economy in its classical and neoclassical forms, and the problem of machines. This course is organized around a reading of Marx’s Capital, Volume One (nearly in its entirety) with short readings from Idealism and Romanticism (Hegel and Novalis), political economy and economics (Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, Rosa Luxemburg, Friedrich Hayek), and the philosophy of technology and media theory (Ada Lovelace, Theodor W. Adorno, Stuart Hall, Jean Baudrillard, Hans Magnus Enzensberger, Donna Haraway). By focusing on the Idealist/Romanticist underpinnings of Marx’s concept of value, we will be able to track the evolution of the value/capital complex from classicism to neoclassicism. Marx’s long chapters on the machinery question also lay the groundwork for understanding the rise of digital capitalism and neoliberalism (alongside readings from Jodi Dean, Sianne Ngai, and Tiziana Terranova). The close reading of Capital will illuminate the increasingly neuralgic intersection of technology and industry.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:06.816Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:06.816Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf2da20bd11405a8228ec","name":"Topics in Modern German Literature and Poetics","location":"Bldg:GCASL  Room:375 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":2,"time":"Mo 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":3488,"department":"[object Promise] (German)","description":"\n\nTaught in English by DAAD Chair for Contemporary Poetics Ann Cotten. 2 credits. \n\"What’s so political about formally innovative poetry?\"\nIn this seminar, I would like to present an array of reasons and strategies, arguments, needs and theories with which poets have come to experimental forms of writing. An attempt at inter- and trans-lingual assessment of the variety of situations in which avant-garde poetry has been produced will inevitably show the limits of a text-only approach, but the calling for in-depth examination of each different political situation will at least open windows. As an eclectic reader and writer, I do not believe in there being one answer to questions of value. Also fear not a rehash of dualistic debates such as the Realism-Formalism debate, though they will be touched upon for ghostbusting purposes.

Realism emerged in the late middle ages before any critical terms were available to analyze and justify it.  Realism was defined oppositionally:  as prose, not poetry; as the profane, not the sacred; and the vernacular or popular, not the language of learning and authority.  The seminar will interpret primary texts and images produced mainly in the German-speaking lands between about 1400 and 1700, including:   saints’ legends, profane legends, vernacular retellings of the Gospel, fables and proverbs, textual and pictorial propaganda of the Protestant Reformation, the realism in the art of Albrecht Dürer and other artists of the period; fictional texts by Hans Sachs, Johann Fischart, and H. J. Ch. von Grimmelshausen; and Schwank or comic literature including Till Eulenspiegel.   More broadly the seminar will address the representation of domesticity, labor, and leisure; portraiture; anecdote and story-telling; “popular culture,” “folklore,” and “folk art”; satire and parody as secularizing forces; exoteric vs. esoteric religion; the boundary between sacred and profane; early genre paintings and prints; autobiography, ego-documents, conversion narratives; the prehistory and form of the novel; proverbs, Kalendergeschichten, novellas; fairy tales, local myths and legends; and vernacular retellings of historical and pagan tales.  The historical material will be framed by critical and theoretical texts of the nineteenth and twentieth century, including Hegel, Nietzsche, Bakhtin, Shklovsky, Auerbach, Benjamin, Jolles, Jameson, Rancière.  Although the primary focus will be on German material, the course will attempt to accommodate students with interests and language-skills in other European traditions.  The visual arts will also be a constant point of reference.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:21.737Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:21.737Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf2e920bd11405a8228f0","name":"The Art & Craft of Teaching","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":0,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2962,"department":"[object Promise] (Grad School of Arts & Science)","description":"null","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:25.210Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:25.210Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf2ec20bd11405a8228f1","name":"Achieving Success through Communication","location":"Bldg:25W4  Room:C-11 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":0,"time":"Mo 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":2900,"department":"[object Promise] (Grad School of Arts & Science)","description":"null","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:28.817Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:28.817Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf2f020bd11405a8228f2","name":"Consortia Courses","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2342,"department":"[object Promise] (Grad School of Arts & Science)","description":"null","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:32.284Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:32.284Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf2f420bd11405a8228f3","name":"Consortia Courses","location":"No Room Required Loc: Off Campus","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2343,"department":"[object Promise] (Grad School of Arts & Science)","description":"null","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:36.024Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:36.024Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf2f720bd11405a8228f4","name":"Consortia Courses","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2344,"department":"[object Promise] (Grad School of Arts & Science)","description":"null","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:39.620Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:39.620Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf2fb20bd11405a8228f5","name":"Consortia Courses","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2345,"department":"[object Promise] (Grad School of Arts & Science)","description":"null","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:43.259Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:43.259Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf2fe20bd11405a8228f6","name":"Consortia Courses","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2346,"department":"[object Promise] (Grad School of Arts & Science)","description":"null","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:46.736Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:46.736Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf30220bd11405a8228f7","name":"Consortia Courses","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2347,"department":"[object Promise] (Grad School of Arts & Science)","description":"null","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:50.256Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:50.256Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf30520bd11405a8228f8","name":"Akkadian IV","location":"King Juan Carlos, Rm 109 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":3,"time":"We 8:00AM - 10:45AM","course_number":19726,"department":"[object Promise] (Hebrew and Judaic Studies)","description":"Reading of Akkadian literature.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:53.838Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:08:53.838Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf30920bd11405a8228f9","name":"Academic Yiddish II","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":3,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2692,"department":"[object Promise] (Hebrew and Judaic Studies)","description":"Intensive study of the language of Yiddish academic discourse.

Comprehensive coverage of such a vast historiography is impossible, but students should emerge from the course with a rough map of some of the most vital and important scholarship on early modern Europe over the last thirty years. The accent of the course will be on the forces that were slowly, or rapidly, transforming Europe in this period. These include economic and environmental changes, especially those linked to the development of agricultural, commercial, and financial capitalism; the changing character and scale of warfare; changes in the form and function of states; transformations in the character of monarchy and ruling elites; shifts in the nature and status of “middling” groups in European societies; pressures for political and social transformation in the guise of popular protest, rebellion, and revolution; religious reforms; and intellectual life.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:11:07.688Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:11:07.688Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf38f20bd11405a82291e","name":"Topics in European History","location":"King Juan Carlos, Rm 717 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Mo 9:30AM - 12:15PM","course_number":20559,"department":"[object Promise] (History)","description":"\n\nThis course examines the origins and development of the various alternatives to liberal capitalism that emerged in the nineteenth century.

Although this course does not attempt to offer a comprehensive survey of racialized theories, we will examine specific moments in time as a means of assessing how race is simultaneously understood and enacted as social construct and lived reality. The topics that we shall investigate include:  scientific racialist theories and their overlap with popular ideas;  immigration; notions of difference, disease, and degeneracy; visual and popular culture;  race, policy, and the law; and “race” in everyday experience and practice.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:11:18.576Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:11:18.576Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf39a20bd11405a822921","name":"20th Century France","location":"15 Washington Mews, Rm B03 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 3:30PM - 6:00PM","course_number":3148,"department":"[object Promise] (History)","description":"\n\nThis course explores the history of France and its empire from the late nineteenth century through decolonization in the 1950s and on to the postcolonial era of the present.

Our collective readings are drawn from the work of historians and anthropologists of Africa in addition to some classic works by economists and political scientists. While most of the readings focus on the 20th and 21st centuries, several weeks will examine themes in the history and archeology of wealth in Africa since the 1500s. Together we will explore how political leaders, farmers, traders, and artisans in diverse African contexts have produced wealth and value by building strategic alliances with people and spirits; transforming and exploiting the natural world; and through violence, seizure, taxation, and trade. We will examine how historians have approached the emergence of new systems of value in coastal West Africa during the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the rise of colonial economies, and the growth of \"popular\" economies and “neo-liberal” economic policies in Africa since independence. The course is designed for graduate students in history and closely allied fields, but it will appeal to any graduate student with an interest in how wealth is produced, imagined, and contested within specific African worlds.

Among the questions at the core of our inquiry will be:  why history matters in Latin American culture and politics, and how interpretations of history reflect concerns in the present.  Much of the course will look at intellectual and cultural production as well as political ideology in the twentieth century in Latin America.

Its aim is to introduce students of international relations to the tools and concepts commonly used in the latter two fields and to promote interdisciplinary cross-pollination. Accordingly, the first half of the course begins with a discussion fo the relationship between international realations, comparative  politics, and area studies and after a brief overview of the benefits of comparative analysis, moves on to weekly discussions of themes commonly studied by scholars of comparative politics such as the modern state and political institutions, democracy and authoritarianism, revolutions and social movements and national and ethnic identity and conflict. The second half of the course uses the area studies framework and treats regions as individual subjects of study.  Through the course, students are encouraged to explore their thematic and regional interests and borrow tools, concepts and theories developed in one scholarly field or geographical region to understand others.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:14:48.852Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:14:48.852Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf46c20bd11405a82295c","name":"Global & Intnl History","location":"Bldg:BOBS  Room:LL142 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Mo 6:20PM - 8:50PM","course_number":2926,"department":"[object Promise] (International Relations)","description":"This course will introduce students to historical analysis of global interactions during the early modern, modern, and contemporary periods. Understanding of today’s international arena requires a well-grounded, conceptually rich understanding of history. The course seeks, in part, to provide historical perspectives on ‘globalization’ and other contemporary global, international and transnational developments. It will focus especially on the history of international order and structures of global power. Topics examined include: war and other forms of political violence; the formation and interaction of empires; imperial expansion and decline; the evolution of the modern state and states systems (including the European states system and its global spread); the proliferation of “nation-states” during the 20th century; the development of international law; and the emergence of international organizations, transnational civil society organizations (aka “NGOs”), and multinational corporations. World historical patterns of long-distance trade, economic change, human migrations, and cross-cultural exchange will also be examined. The course does not aim to present a comprehensive world history but introduces themes and analytical approaches that are foundational to more advanced study of international interactions.","component":"Lecture","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:14:52.331Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:14:52.331Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf47020bd11405a82295d","name":"International Relations","location":"Bldg: 7E12  Rm: 121 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Th 3:30PM - 6:00PM","course_number":20223,"department":"[object Promise] (International Relations)","description":"\n\nThis course offers a graduate-level introduction to theories of international politics and to some of the important aspects of international politics.

There was humanitarian intervention already in the 19th century, undertaken by European states to protect Christians, mostly against the Ottoman Empire. However, it is only after the end of the Cold War that there have been serious challenges to existing legal and political notions of state sovereignty and war. Since then, intervention has come to be better known as the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), an emerging norm of war with a just cause. This class will take a case study approach to address the political, legal and ethical aspects of R2P. It will discuss crucial questions, when and how is it just to intervene?; what are the outcomes of intervention or the lack of it? The goal is to portray problems and responsibilities of an array of state and non-state actors using the interesting and difficult humanitarian emergencies of Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, East Timor, Rwanda, Darfur and more recently Libya and Syria. While cases will enable students to experience interventions (or lack of intervention), through the behavior of actual participants, a survey of the main norm-setting documents will serve to establish a genealogy of R2P, as well as the political and intellectual arguments that lay out its justification and limits.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:15:21.175Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:15:21.175Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf48c20bd11405a822965","name":"National Security Strategies of Countries in Middle East","location":"Rubin Hall, 35 5th Ave, Rm 101 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Fr 9:30AM - 12:00PM","course_number":20220,"department":"[object Promise] (International Relations)","description":"\n\nAt the crossroads of three continents, the Middle East is home to many diverse peoples, with ancient and proud cultures, in varying stages of political and socio-economic development, often times in conflict. Now in a state of historic flux, the Arab Spring and subsequent upheaval, have transformed the Middle Eastern landscape, with great consequence for the national security strategies of the countries of the region and the international community. The course surveys the national security challenges facing the region's primary players today (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, the Palestinians, and Turkey) and how the convolutions of recent years have affected them. Unlike many Middle East courses, which focus on US policy in the region, the course concentrates on the regional players' perceptions of the threats and opportunities they face and on the strategies they have adopted to deal with them.\nAs a contemporary policy-oriented course, students will assume the role of senior decision makers from the different countries and draft “policy papers” to their heads of state, elucidating the various issues and recommending means of resolving them. In addition to learning the complexities of the issues, students will also deal with the challenging process of drafting real-world policy papers and recommendations.

Strategic planning is based on analytical processes and methodologies that are fundamentally different from those taught in academic programs and graduates lack the practical “real world” skills sought by employers, who are hesitant to hire them. The initial period of employment thus becomes a difficult process of on-the-job training. The course will teach the methodologies and skills required for real world policy planning, increasing students’ prospects of employment and making them useful employees from the start. The course is highly practical, a nearly real-world policy planning workshop. In the role of senior decision-makers from countries of their choice, students will draft policy papers and formulate recommendations from the perspective of the actual leaders in power. The need to consider matters in this light, from the real world leaders’ perspective, not what students believe to be right, often has a transformational impact on students’ thinking. The heart of the course is class discussion, in which students engage in a directed critique of each other’s draft policy papers, much as is done in senior planning forums, as part of a collaborative effort to help improve the final paper.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:15:46.254Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:15:46.254Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf4a520bd11405a82296c","name":"Country Risk Analysis","location":"Bldg:BOBS  Room:837 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Fr 9:30AM - 12:00PM","course_number":3288,"department":"[object Promise] (International Relations)","description":"Over the past decades, the level of foreign direct investment, international lending, and cross-border trade has dramatically grown. Global investors and lenders realized that economics and politics are deeply intertwined in emerging markets and developing countries and began to develop more sophisticated tools for an assessment of political, economic, and financial risks. Country risk analysis is now used as a screening device to avoid conducting business in countries with excessive risk and as a tool for making long-term investment or financial decisions. This course provides a broad overview of multiple approaches to country risk assessment and fosters students’ analytical skills so that they can complete an assessment of political, economic, and financial risks in a host country.

After the post-Yalta division of Europe, this area became a central focus of Cold War rivalry using all forms of traditional and public diplomacy. The end of the Soviet Union, the fall of communist regimes in former-Warsaw Pact countries, the re-creation of independent countries in post-Soviet space, and the enlargement of NATO and the EU set the stage for today's conflicts in Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova.

It examines early writings about Irish identity and Irish immigrant experiences by African-American writers before the Civil War, and also considers how the wave of Irish immigrants arriving after the Irish famine were incorporated into the racial power structure of American society in complex and contradictory ways.  The emergence of Irish American writing on racial identities between Reconstruction and the First World War is considered alongside the early works of African American literature that attempted to understand racialized power through depictions of “passing” and of the color line.  The course considers in some detail the strong connections between the Irish and Harlem Renaissances, looking at the strong but hidden legacy of mixed-race descendants of Irish and African-American peoples.  It concludes by examining the occluded legacy of mixed race people in American culture, the persistence of Blackface in racial performance, and the emergence of new Irish identities formed in Ireland by non-white Irish people.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:16:52.016Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:16:52.016Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf4e720bd11405a82297e","name":"Independent Study","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":2,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2615,"department":"[object Promise] (Irish Studies)","description":"Designed to allow flexibility in coursework otherwise unavailable via regular course offerings.

This lab-like seminar focuses on the mid-nineteenth century when immigration from Ireland dramatically altered New York politically, socially and culturally. Students will study an Irish neighborhood in Manhattan or the Irish in a specific occupation at a microscopic level. They will work alone and in groups on a project which involves the collection of textual, numeric, and visual data, as well as occasional fieldwork. They will acquire basic skills in data management, analysis, and graphic presentation through hands-on work with spreadsheets, databases, Google products, and geographic/spatial programs, then translate these skills into web-based presentations. Students will create content using (1) traditional research methods to write narratives about the New York Irish in the 1850s and (2) digital humanities methods to interpret quantitative data extracted from the records of the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank and other public records like the 1855 New York State census. Final grades are assessed on the quality of the integrations of those two elements as well as class participation (attendance, readings, discussions). The ability to think historically, evaluate evidence, and bridge past and present are the ultimate goals.

The French translation of Boileau (1674) starts the fortune of the treatise and its dissemination through Europe between the 18th and the 20th centuries. Rather than concentrating on the fortune of the sublime, most recent studies have focused on the origin of this idea by showing that its roots are part of the ancient Greek and Latin Culture, and that although the word itself was not used before the first century BC, the concept existed long before. A basic assumption is that the pseudo Longinus treatise, dated between the second and third century, was not an original work and that it was a product of the Platonism of the time.\n \nThe course considers the sources of the sublime in the Greek and Latin rhetoric of grand style. It evaluates the importance of this notion in the biblical theological tradition, as well as in the Neoplatonic and Neoplatonic Christian authors such as Plotinus, the pseudo Dionysius, Augustine, Gregory the Great, Richard of Saint Victor, and others.\n \nClasses will be devoted to reading and discussing texts in the vernacular Italian tradition in both prose and poetry, tracing the making of this idea and its evolution from the first lyric poetry of the 13th century to authors such as Dante, Petrarch, the Platonic school of Florence, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Vittoria Colonna, Galileo, Vico, Leopardi, and Montale.  In this perspective, the course also offers a kind of introduction to the theory of the sublime, as it develops from the 16th century to today, as in the work of Burke, Vico, Kant, Hegel, and Lyotard.\n \nThe course will be given in English.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:17:06.880Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:17:06.880Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf4f620bd11405a822982","name":"Genres of Italian Lit:","location":"Casa Italiana, Rm 203 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Th 3:30PM - 6:10PM","course_number":20023,"department":"[object Promise] (Italian)","description":"\n\nThis course aims to provide graduate students and advanced undergraduates with a foundation in theoretical approaches to Italian literary studies.

Some of the period's most characteristic products were born out of the conviction that concepts could be systematically turned into images — and that such images could be organized into a visual language, more profound and universal than discursive logic. Egyptian hieroglyphs and dream visions, in their mysterious graphic exuberance, were considered typical vehicles of this advanced mode of communication. The desire to emulate their symbolic density is reflected both in literature and in art, often in ways that challenge common distinctions between visual and verbal communication. In this course you will be introduced to an assortment of works representative of such interplay between text and image: emblem books, dream books and dream-centered works, hieroglyphic inventions and studies, collections of proverbs, iconology manuals, etc. Among the books examined are some widely considered as the finest examples of design in the history of printing. Early modern and recent theory of emblems will also be discussed. As a present-day counterpart of Renaissance emblems, the course will conclude with a survey of corporate logos and Russian criminal tattoos.

Purgatory is the only one of the three realms of the afterlife that is located above ground, on the earth, subject to the passage of time.  Literally upside-down, it is in many ways a new place, shaped by late medieval preoccupations with time and money as well as female and lay participation in religiosity, and its concerns are emphatically earthly: reason, politics, justice, ethics, and art.  It is a place in between, a middle ground, a condition of suffering and hope, a spiritual gym, participant in an economy of connection and advocacy shared by the living and the dead.  Knowledge of Italian is helpful, but not required as all readings will be available in translation.  Interest in connecting the Purgatorio to its intellectual, cultural, and political roots, as well as to those of its aftermath, in whatever cultural tradition, will be strongly encouraged.

Why did Leopardi turn to the Greek poetess Sappho to voice his own concerns about the miserable state of human beings? What did Sappho’s tragic fate tell Leopardi about the role of poetry in human life? While these questions are not easy to answer, the poet’s treatment of Sappho provides us with a most fruitful lens through which to look at the complex ways in which the poetical culture of Italy developed in the decades around 1800, hanging in the balance between concurrent (and, to some extent, conflicting) trends: indeed, Leopardi’s Sappho captures the tension between the permanence of “classicist” poetical forms and the circulation of “romantic” motifs that characterized the peculiar way in which Italy received and responded to European Romanticism. In fact, Leopardi’s poem is part of a rich series of texts that, in conjunction with the modern rediscovery of Sappho’s poetry, contributed to trigger a veritable “Sappho fever” throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. By exploring significant installments of Sappho’s afterlife in the period, this seminar aims to introduce students to the “classicist” roots of Italian Romanticism by studying two interrelated topics: namely, the status of the poetess’s voice vis-à-vis the poetical uses of her myth; and the relevance of such uses to broader questions about the reception of antiquity within the poetical culture of Italian Romanticism.

Studying Quechua opens a window onto alternative ways of thinking about social worlds, about space and time, family, and humans' relationship with the natural world. Quechua is recommended for students anticipating travel to the Andean region, those interested in language and linguistics, and those interested in indigenous literatures and cultures.

Political parties, institutions and collective behavior of individuals are central components in the field. Thus, political science will often focus more on political parties, the military, government bureaucracies and revolutionary forces than on labor unions, peasants or disposed groups. In short, political science tends to show a bias towards elite studies. Perhaps as a signal that traditionally disposed groups are acquiring greater political power, non-elite studies have grown and enriched the field in recent years. Yet, the primary research focus continues to be the State and how different groups influence (or seek to influence) the State.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:21:03.910Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:21:03.910Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf5e320bd11405a8229c4","name":"Topics Seminar:","location":"Bldg:19Univ Pl  Room:223 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 1:55PM - 3:55PM","course_number":2352,"department":"[object Promise] (Latin Amer-Caribbean Studies)","description":"\n\nTaught by NYTimes columnist David Gonzalez.

Students learn about contending paradigms of sovereignty, patrimony, liberalism, citizenship, and development. The course examines the development of democratic national government and periodic authoritarian rule, as well as social violence, foreign military intervention, and civil war. The course also treats continuing problems of inequality, and the impact of pressure by other countries and international organizations on political and economic arrangements in the region. Alongside of such issues, students are introduced to expressive culture and the arts, to competing paradigms of formal and commemorative memory and history, and to the emergence of tourism and the UNESCO-associated ?culture industry?. The course ends with in-depth analysis of the impact of globalization, neoliberal policies, emerging social movements, increased political participation and decentralization of governance, and the rise of populist governments. Throughout the course, students work closely with instructors to develop a scholarly genealogy of key concepts and processes within which they will be able to frame the themes and methods of their Master?s Projects.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:21:18.726Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:21:18.726Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf5f220bd11405a8229c8","name":"Seminar:","location":"King Juan Carlos, Rm 404 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 2:00PM - 4:30PM","course_number":3170,"department":"[object Promise] (Latin Amer-Caribbean Studies)","description":"\n\nFeminist and Indigenous Pedagogies: Democratic Challenges in Latin American Education","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:21:22.280Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:21:22.280Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf5f520bd11405a8229c9","name":"Tinker Colloquium I:","location":"Off-Campus Loc: Off Campus","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 2:10PM - 4:00PM","course_number":2354,"department":"[object Promise] (Latin Amer-Caribbean Studies)","description":"\n\nCourse taught on Columbia campus.

OPEN TO CLACS STUDENTS ONLY.\n\nINDIGENOUS PEOPLES MOVEMENT \n\nIndigenous Peoples, numbering more that 370 million in some 90 countries and about 5000 groups and representing a great part of the world’s human diversity and cultural heritage, continue to raise major controversies and to face threats to their physical and cultural existence. The main task of this course is to explore the complex historic circumstances and political actions that gave rise to the international Indigenous movement through the human rights agenda and thus also produced a global Indigenous identity on all continents, two intertwined and deeply significant phenomena over the past fifty years.  We will analyze the achievements, challenges and potential of the dynamic interface between the Indigenous Peoples’ movement-one of the strongest social movements of our times- and the international community, especially the United Nations system. Centered on the themes laid out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007), the course will examine how Indigenous Peoples have been contesting and reshaping norms, institutions and global debates in the past 50 years, re-shaping and gradually decolonizing international institutions and how they have contributed to some of the most important contemporary debates, including human rights, development,  law, and specifically the concepts of self-determination, governance, group rights, inter-culturality and pluriculturality, gender, land, territories and natural resources, cultural rights, intellectual property, health, education, the environment and climate justice. The syllabus will draw on a variety of academic literature, case studies and documentation of Indigenous organizations, the UN and other intergovernmental organizations as well as States from different parts of the world. Students will also have the opportunity to meet with Indigenous leaders and representatives of international organizations and States and will be encouraged to attend the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. Select short films will be shown and discussed in class.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:21:33.081Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:21:33.081Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf60120bd11405a8229cc","name":"Sp Tpcs:","location":"Room: TBA Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"MoWeFr 12:30PM - 1:45PM","course_number":3009,"department":"[object Promise] (Latin Amer-Caribbean Studies)","description":"\n\nElementary Haitian Kreyol II (Creole).

But how do politics actually happen in museums? What has \"politics\" meant for key exhibitions and collections and what avenues of political theory emerge from the museum in general? In this seminar, we will move beyond the general to examine how specific political concepts took shape in historic exhibitions and museum practices from the 1930s to the present. As such, our challenge will be twofold. On the one hand, we will consider how political movements have used the museums as an implement for advancing power and influence. On the other hand, we will consider how museum practices have \"taken up\" various kinds of politics: how museum objects and officials have engaged and advocated the agendas and outcomes of political parties, governments, policies, revolutions, and elections. Case studies will include: Degenerate Art (1937), Paris World Exhibition (1937), Rivera's \"Man at the Crossroads\" (1934), The Guggenheim Museum (1959), Yad Vashem (1965), Harlem on my Mind (1969), The Perfect Moment (1990), The Last Act (1994), The Jewish Museum of Bologna (1998), Sensation (1999), The Apartheid Museum (2001), Holocaust Cartoons (2006), among others. Through these case studies, students will examine the museum's role in the public sphere and the process whereby exhibitions contribute to-- or undermined--key aspects of deliberative democracy.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:29:28.555Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:29:28.555Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf7dc20bd11405a822a51","name":"Art Exhibition History After 1960","location":"Bldg:240 Greene  Room:410 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"We 2:00PM - 5:00PM","course_number":21573,"department":"[object Promise] (Museum Studies)","description":"This seminar will investigate the history of exhibitions and various approaches to the study of exhibition history.

These developments include the growth of independent curating and new curatorial strategies, an increasing focus on thematic exhibitions, the expansion of biennials outside the Euro-American centers, and the use of discursive forms.

Natural history and anatomical collections, from the private Wunderkammern of the early modern period to the AMNH’s award-winning Hall of Biodiversity, have consistently struggled with the politics and poetics of representing objects without names, immaterial objects difficult to describe, and objects that, in fact, never existed at all. Using these “invisible objects” as our entry point over the course of the semester, we will trace the rise and fall of private and public natural history and anatomical collections from the Enlightenment to the present. Ranging from so-called monsters to rotting plants and stars, we approach the history of museums by investigating how the contentious categories of science and art have worked together (and sometimes at odds) to make visible objects that have eluded collection, classification, preservation, and display.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:29:49.880Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:29:49.880Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf7f120bd11405a822a57","name":"Exhibition Planning & Design","location":"Bldg:240 Greene  Room:410 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Tu 10:00AM - 1:00PM","course_number":2586,"department":"[object Promise] (Museum Studies)","description":"This course focuses on the planning, development, and design of exhibitions, permanent, temporary, and traveling.

One is the existence of mathematical objects such as numbers, sets, functions and structures.  The other is the objectivity of mathematical questions, even when those questions are undecidable in our best theories.  The two questions are separable, and I’d like the course to focus on the second. (One version of anti-objectivism, the view advocated in my old Science Without Numbers, also takes a stand against mathematical objects.  But there are other views, e.g. some forms of mathematical conventionalism, and Joel Hamkins’ doctrine of the set-theoretic multiverse, that seem to advocate non-objectivity without denying mathematical objects.  And Geoffrey Hellman’s development of Putnam’s “mathematics as modal logic” is a form of objectivism that doesn’t posit mathematical objects.)\n\nThere are also issues about the objectivity of logic that are at least superficially related.  Especially since there are some mathematical theories (e.g. Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis”) that rely essentially on non-classical logic.\n\nOne issue we’ll discuss is whether we can make sense of non-objectivism about any domain (not just math and logic), and if so, how?  (Some arguments of a “deflationist” sort seem to suggest that we can’t.)  Another issue will be whether there are specific limits on our ability to make sense of non-objectivity in math and logic.  In the case of mathematics, it is often thought that arithmetic, or at least an important fragment of it, is immune to serious doubts about objectivity.  (There’s more than one possible ground for this.)  Is this so?  If so, does it serve as an entering wedge that forces us to accept a great deal of objectivity even about typical undecidable sentences in set theory?  (Peter Koellner has argued in this vein.)  \n\nOne route (far from the only one) to arguing for the objectivity of certain questions is to argue for particular answers to them, even if those answers don’t strictly follow from what has previously been accepted.  Godel’s Theorem is sometimes viewed as holding out hope for this route to objectivity.

The focus will be on discussions of logical consequence and the nature of conditionals throughout the centuries. We will begin with Aristotle's theory of the categorical syllogism, the Stoic system of propositional logic, and their reception in late antiquity. We will go on to consider Abelard's account of conditionals, and Buridan's theory of consequences. We will study parts of the logical work of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Bernard Bolzano. Finally, we will consider the algebraic approach to logic developed in the 19th century in the works of Boole, DeMorgan, Jevons, Peirce, and Schroeder, as well as the critique of this approach by Frege.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:02.504Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:02.504Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf87620bd11405a822a7c","name":"Topics in Epistemology","location":"5 Washington Pl, Rm 202 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Mo 11:00AM - 1:00PM","course_number":3457,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"\n\nWe'll be looking mostly at literature in epistemology (but some in ethics, or straddling these fields) from the past decade, addressing higher-order norms, defeaters, akrasia, and disagreement.

This question is most often posed about epistemically justified beliefs about what's practically rational for you to do, but can also be posed about epistemically justified beliefs about what's epistemically rational for you to believe.\n\n* When is it reasonable to not merely be confident that P, but to settle upon having a stable, all-out belief that P? When is it reasonable to suspend belief about P?\n\n* What is the relation between what attitudes your reasons/evidence/justification now recommends or requires you to have, and what further investigative or deliberative activities it recommends or requires you to go in for?\n\n* What should we think about the phenomena that prompt \"wide-scope\" accounts of rational norms or requirements?

Here are two of those ways:\n1. We will go over experiments done to learn about what are some of the most basic moral convictions of (the great majority of) people relevantly like ourselves - contemporary rather highly educated people, mostly educated along lines that have prevailed in the West for the last 50 years or more.\n\nHere is a question- or a group of questions -  addressed by some of these experimental studies:  What factors most heavily determine how it is that (most) people like us assess the moral status of this or that agent’s behavior, in one or another situation.   Was the behavior at least morally all right?  Or, was it badly wrong; or what? \nSome of the experimental work studied will have been done only by others – the most recent will have been done by the instructor and his collaborators, the latter being, at least in the main, experimental psychologists. \n\n2. Most ethical principles offered by philosophers, and by many others, too, have been formulated in rather simple terms, using handy phrases.   For example, that is true of both:\nA. Other things equal, it’s badly wrong to kill an innocent person, even if it’s only with the taking of this life that the lives of other innocents, more than just one, can be saved.\nB. Other things equal, it is quite alright to kill an innocent person if it’s only with the taking of this life that the lives of other innocents, more than just one, can be saved.\n\nAmbient (i.e.) outdoor toxic air pollutions kills almost 3,000,000 people a year, most of this, by far, occurring in Asia.  (Most people are in Asia.)  Consider the behavior of the multi-billionaire CEOs of huge Asian corporations – think mostly of India and China, the world leaders  Each of them controls a giant company that produces, every year, a great deal of toxic air pollution.   For good measure, focus on the CEOs of companies that don’t produce anything people really need, but make, say, very many stylish purses, or lots of alcoholic beverages.\n\nPlease notice this:  Even in his or her very greatly adding to the lethal toxic pollution plaguing the world, none of these horribly indifferent moguls harms anyone at all, not even the least little bit - much less does any of them take a single innocent person’s life, or kill even as much as just one single person or, for that matter, even a single puppy dog.\nBut, as most of us want to say, each of them has behaved very, very badly. Why is it that these powerful multibillionaires have behaved so terribly wrongly, every last one of them having engaged in morally horrible behavior?\n\nMaybe there’s a pretty easy and straightforward answer here – or maybe not.  In either event, the attempt at an answer gets us into a way of doing ethics that’s very different from all previous work in the subject, as all that previous work says nothing about (the moral status of) the behavior of our noted CEOs. Indeed, all that old work provides no terms with which we may assess the moral status of most of the morally most horrible behavior that, for the last 40 years, or more, has been done by human beings.\n\nIn this course, we will try to provide better material, much more relevant to modern times, than that old stuff.  Will we have any success?  I’m pretty sure we’ll have at least a very, very  little bit, but I have no idea whether we’ll have any more than that.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:09.519Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:09.519Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf87d20bd11405a822a7e","name":"Philosophical Research","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2708,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"\n\nPERMISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRED.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:13.120Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:13.120Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf88120bd11405a822a7f","name":"Philosophical Research","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2709,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"\n\nPERMISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRED.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:17.164Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:17.164Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf88420bd11405a822a80","name":"Philosophical Research","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2710,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"\n\nPERMISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRED.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:20.927Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:20.927Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf88820bd11405a822a81","name":"Philosophical Research","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2711,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"\n\nPERMISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRED.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:24.515Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:24.515Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf88c20bd11405a822a82","name":"Human Dignity Seminar","location":"Bldg:FURH  Room:C10 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":2,"time":"Th 5:00PM - 6:50PM","course_number":23371,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"null","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:28.113Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:28.113Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf88f20bd11405a822a83","name":"Thesis Research","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":21271,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"For Ph.D. students who have completed core requirements.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:31.628Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:31.628Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf89320bd11405a822a84","name":"Associated Writing","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2713,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"Required writing course for Ph.D. students.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:35.267Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:35.267Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf89620bd11405a822a85","name":"Associated Writing","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":1,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":2714,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"Required writing course for Ph.D. students.","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:38.787Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:38.787Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf89a20bd11405a822a86","name":"Third Year Review Preparation Course","location":"No Room Required Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Room: TBA","course_number":20825,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"null","component":"null","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:42.340Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:42.340Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf89d20bd11405a822a87","name":"Work in Progress Seminar","location":"5 Washington Pl, Rm 202 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Th 11:00AM - 1:00PM","course_number":20683,"department":"[object Promise] (Philosophy)","description":"null","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:45.984Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:32:45.984Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedf8a120bd11405a822a88","name":"Elect for Scientists I","location":"Meyer Hall, Rm 221 Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Mo 12:30PM - 4:30PM","course_number":19831,"department":"[object Promise] (Physics)","description":"Linear circuit theory, active components, and basic principles of circuit design.

Taking critiques of Cartesianism as a point of departure, we will examine forms of subjectivity that are not considered independent, or even interdependent, but primarily relational, co-implicated, or entangled. Accounting for the recent interest in and critique of relationality from philosophies of care and friendship (Blanchot, Derrida, Foucault), ethics and psychoanalysis (Levinas, Winnicott, Laplanche, Klein, Bollas), and aesthetics (Bourriaud, Rancière), to postcolonial and queer theory (Glissant, Gandhi; Bersani, Edelman, Sedgwick, Edelman), we will study a range of literary texts and films that stage crises of non-relation or negate normative relationality in order to invent “new relational modes”.

This course examines a variety of interpersonal approaches, with emphasis on several recent theoretical perspectives (adult attachment theory, models about ruptures and repairs of the therapeutic alliance, and others) that provide very helpful guides for research and practice.

Yet, religion does not function simply as unchanging content, while media names the ways that content is formed. Instead shifts in media technique, from ritual innovations to the invention of printing, through TV, to the internet, also shape religious practice.  We are interested in gathering theoretical tools for understanding the form and politics of this mutual dialectic.

After establishing a shared foundation, we will read a set of recent sociological works that explicitly explore persisting material inequalities and whites’ political-, racial-, and class-consciousness in the contemporary U.S. context. Students are expected to read assigned materials in advance of class, respond to readings (in weekly memos), and to lead some class discussions. In addition to discussing readings and work-shopping students’ current projects, the class will be a forum for imagining and advancing future critical research projects, developing conference panel ideas, and designing future courses.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:42:10.687Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:42:10.687Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedfad620bd11405a822b23","name":"Interdisciplinary Sem:","location":"Room: TBA Loc: Washington Square","school":"Graduate School of Arts and Science","units":4,"time":"Th 9:30AM - 12:00PM","course_number":24421,"department":"[object Promise] (Sociology)","description":"\n\nAlthough Americans debate how much race influences social, political and economic outcomes, they generally believe it plays some role in daily life.

In this course we will consider the challenges of comparing diverse notions of human difference that are rooted in distinct historical and national settings. Beginning with a case study of contemporary Italy, home to a growing foreign-born population as well as a vociferous xenophobic movement, we will move to an exploration of beliefs about “race” or related groupings—such as “ethnicity” or “tribe”—in Latin America, Asia, and the North African and Middle Eastern region. Our objective will be to use comparative analysis to shed new light on—and help us rethink—even the classificatory systems that are most familiar to us.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T07:42:14.766Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T07:42:14.766Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedfada20bd11405a822b24","name":"Seminar:","location":"295 Lafayette, Rm 4155

Indeed, our fascination with all things autobiographical attests to the importance of examining one particular life in order to understand larger issues concerning culture, community, race, gender and even social and global transformations. Narrative Ethnography is also a form of writing which uses the first person pronoun. In this genre, “participant observation” - actually experiencing the beliefs, rituals and life-ways of another culture first hand - is the methodology employed in order to explicitly understand not just the self, but the ‘other’. What are the differences between memoir and ethnography? What kinds of knowledge travel in each? How does writing in the first person challenge other modes of knowledge production? How might memoir and ethnography contribute to our understanding of cultural and cross-cultural dialogue, while providing a post-colonial critique? In this course we examine the rhetorical and aesthetic rules that govern these genres, as well as the way they create social imaginations that go on to live political lives in the world.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T08:03:59.125Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T08:03:59.125Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dedfff220bd11405a822c8d","name":"Listening to Islam","location":"East Admin (A4-006) Loc: Abu Dhabi","school":"NYU Abu Dhabi - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"MoWe 1:15PM - 2:30PM","course_number":21822,"department":"[object Promise] (Anthropology)","description":"What kinds of knowledge pass through the ear?

Moving the focus away from politics and religion, this course explores the everyday worlds of Middle Eastern youths and the complex interactions - with institutions, peers and family members - which characterize their daily lives. By analyzing multiple youth cultures divided along the lines of gender, ethnicity, religious affiliation, or social class, students will address the diversity of Middle Eastern youths and question the universality of age categories. A large space will also be devoted to the voices of Middle Eastern youths themselves, from Egyptian literature and Emirati cinema to Moroccan hip-hop. These cultural productions will allow students to look at the way Arab youths use globalized artistic genres to address regional issues and express their fears, hopes and desires.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T08:04:13.760Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T08:04:13.760Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dee000120bd11405a822c91","name":"Problems and Methods in Arab Crossroads Studies","location":"Comp Research (A2-004) Loc: Abu Dhabi","school":"NYU Abu Dhabi - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"TuTh 1:15PM - 2:30PM","course_number":18327,"department":"[object Promise] (Arab Crossroads Studies)","description":"This seminar introduces students to the main theoretical and epistemological trends in the study of the Arab crossroads region, and offers practical examples of the methodologies used by scholars in the humanities and the qualitative social sciences.

Some of the most radical outcomes of art movements of the 1960s only emerged in the 1970s and 1980s with so-called “institutional critique”, whereas a strong resistance to exactly this genealogy made itself felt in a wave of neo-expressionist painting (Arte Cifra, Neue Wilde, figuration libre, Transavantguardia, New Image Painting). This was countered by the “picture generation” whose image production was based on photography and related to discussions of “postmodernism” and of “appropriation”. Female artists gained in stature to a previously unprecedented degree (especially in video and photography) and made gender-issues and relations of power a major theme in art.

Though most readily embrace such visual testimony, we might also cede Susan Sontag’s point that photos are a “species of rhetoric” that “simplify” and “create the illusion of consensus.” In what ways do a photographer’s choices of what to include and exclude suggest self-conscious framing from a specific vantage point? What ethical questions emerge from this tension between the medium’s supposed objectivity and the photographer’s admitted subjectivity? Students will explore ethical scenarios in photojournalism, travel photography, street photography, portraiture, and commercial photography as they confront questions about consent, privacy, representation, citizen responsibility, and propaganda.

A series of historical investigations into philosophical definitions, visual and literary expressions, key official documents, and personal narratives will lead the class to ask whether the contemporary period may recover or conserve the liberating potential of dignity in our evolving world system.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T08:09:25.208Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T08:09:25.208Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dee013820bd11405a822ce7","name":"Conserving Our Global Heritage through Science","location":"Comp Research (A2-017) Loc: Abu Dhabi","school":"NYU Abu Dhabi - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"TuTh 10:25AM - 11:40AM","course_number":18297,"department":"[object Promise] (Core: Colloquium)","description":"What is “global heritage”? Is it simply our collective legacy as human societies – how we want to be remembered by future generations – or must we confront more difficult questions about identity, the ownership of culture, and conflicts between local and global stewardship of the cultural treasures and historical evidence? With time, negligence, and even military conflict working to erase the past, we must ask: Can a better understanding of our shared heritage assist us in addressing cultural differences in the present day? And how can science both help us understand the historic record and work to preserve it? This class examines ways in which scientific methods can help define “global heritage” and protect it for future generations. Students explore the history and the science behind the creation of paintings, frescoes, parchments, sculptures, ancient mummies, historical buildings, musical instruments, and other artifacts. They will also examine the methods used to differentiate between an authentic object and a fake and ask how some objects come to be valued more than others: distinctions that can lead, and have led, to cultural conflict in recent years.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T08:09:28.944Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T08:09:28.944Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dee013c20bd11405a822ce8","name":"Water","location":"West Admin (A3-001) Loc: Abu Dhabi","school":"NYU Abu Dhabi - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"MoWe 11:50AM - 1:05PM","course_number":18520,"department":"[object Promise] (Core: Colloquium)","description":"Water is the life blood of existence.

This course explores the ways in which the desert has been depicted and experienced in various historical, cultural, and geographic contexts – from the Sahara to the Mojave, from the origins of Abrahamic religions to Burning Man, from desert oasis to urban food desert. This course will also consider the future of deserts and global challenges posed by climate change, desertification, and resources (water, oil, solar). Students will encounter the desert through diverse sources that include film, literature, soundscapes, musical performances, environmental and social history, artistic production, fieldtrips, and travel writings. So, even while the desert is an environmental reality that makes inhabitation difficult, it is still a space of demographic, cultural, and economic activity and exchange.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T08:09:36.513Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T08:09:36.513Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dee014320bd11405a822cea","name":"Life in the Universe","location":"Comp Research (A2-020) Loc: Abu Dhabi","school":"NYU Abu Dhabi - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"MoWe 9:00AM - 10:15AM","course_number":18225,"department":"[object Promise] (Core: Colloquium)","description":"How did life form on Earth?

This course will examine how our understanding of human physiology, genetics, and development, as well as methods of investigations of human anatomy, have shaped the perception of the human body, through history, and across cultures. Students will examine the function of the body and how the understanding of bodily functions has changed (the working body). The course will also delve into the modifications the human body has experienced evolutionarily and how our own body is changing from a single cell until death (the changing body).

Animal research has also been essential to addressing the global challenges to preserve declining and endangered species. This course tackles a number of biological paradigms where the animal has been a central figure. What determines which animals we use as subjects in research? What are the ethical and moral implications of animal-based experiments? How have animal-based research discoveries been communicated in the scientific community and popular media? And how might we tackle environmental and conservation issues through a non-human lens?

They will consider the Fourth Industrial Revolution as an opportunity to critique theories of technological change and construct their own narratives of change in individual case study analysis assignments.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T08:10:41.064Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T08:10:41.064Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dee018420bd11405a822cfc","name":"Body Politics","location":"Comp Research (A2-021) Loc: Abu Dhabi","school":"NYU Abu Dhabi - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"MoWe 9:00AM - 10:15AM","course_number":23911,"department":"[object Promise] (Core: Colloquium)","description":"The body plays a central role in today’s global challenges, including in the promotion of justice, equality, health, and human rights. But controversies surrounding these aspirations also reveal the existence of divergent––often opposing––definitions of the body. This course asks how current political struggles over issues such as gender identity, racism, and reproductive and human rights involve conflicting understandings of the body. What relationships do these notions establish or depend upon between the body, identity, power, and truth? How do body politics inform debates about the anti-vaccination movement, “political correctness,” or body modifications? To denaturalize our ideas about the body, the course combines the exploration of current trends with the examination of views from diverse time periods and cultures. By identifying and analyzing these contrasting assumptions, the course seeks to better understand the challenges we face today, and how to address them. Major topics will include the problem of embodiment and the limits of our bodies; the role the body plays in the definition of racial and gender identities; bodily disciplines; and the human quest for truth.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T08:10:44.771Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T08:10:44.771Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dee018820bd11405a822cfd","name":"Foodways: Culture, Ethics, Sustainability","location":"Comp Research (A2-021) Loc: Abu Dhabi","school":"NYU Abu Dhabi - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"TuTh 9:00AM - 10:15AM","course_number":23504,"department":"[object Promise] (Core: Colloquium)","description":"We’ve all heard the truism: “You are what you eat.” But are we also how we eat and how we procure what we eat? In an era of industrial food production and global climate change, we may need to ask what should we eat, in order to meet the challenges of food security and sustainable development. This colloquium asks what and how food can tell us about individual and community identities. It also asks how the ethics of individual food choice relates to the world's food systems. From the global Slow Food movement to novel approaches to food security and sovereignty here in the Gulf, what are the cultural politics of food? Is responsible eating a privilege or a human right? How do patterns in the production, distribution, and consumption of food promote such subjectivities as race, class, gender, and nation? How can asking what to eat serve as a vehicle for understanding the construction of such categories or contradictions in consumer behavior? How do scholars in various disciplines research local foodways in the context of the global food system?

What constraints of traditional agriculture shape pre-industrial societies? Does human population, as the famous British political economist Thomas Malthus argued in 1798, increase faster than the means of subsistence, and if so, what are the implications? People need food and the production of food needs people (and land). The world’s population grew slowly, with major setbacks, from perhaps 200 million people in AD 1 to about 600 million in 1700 and to 2.3 billion on the eve of WW II. In just seventy years, it has soared to 7.7 billion, and the UN projects a total of 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 in 2100. How, then, has the per-capita intake of calories not declined worldwide and the balance of nutrients arguably improved? If past population growth was made possible by unprecedented agricultural expansion, will the future require a comparable increase?

Even the possession of supernatural powers recurs in the tales in the form of an accusation made against perceived outsiders. The reception of the Nights tales in Europe animated the new sciences of anthropology and psychology, suggesting alternative modes of modernity less strictly beholden to Enlightenment reason. Cultural difference piqued the interest of the translators who brought the Nights to Europe and pioneered travelogues and ethnographies of the Levant, Egypt, and Arabia.

Through class discussions and visits to the Louvre Abu Dhabi Museum, the course will examine a host of related ideas: the rhetorical concept of “energeia,” camouflage, iconoclasm, “animism” in prehistoric rock art, Western and Asian landscape imagery, medieval relics and miracle imagery, anthropomorphism and witchcraft in the early modern period, and the idea of “living presence” in abstract expressionism.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T08:11:12.883Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T08:11:12.883Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dee01a420bd11405a822d05","name":"Dis/Abilities in Musical Contexts","location":"Arts Center (C3-116) Loc: Abu Dhabi","school":"NYU Abu Dhabi - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"MoWe 1:15PM - 2:30PM","course_number":18268,"department":"[object Promise] (Core: Cultural Exploration & A)","description":"This course asks what dis/Ability is and considers how this concept plays out within a variety of musical contexts.

How might a close examination of falconry help explain the emergence and transformation of social categories such as nobility and poverty, male and female, believer and pagan, citizen and foreigner?

As the emergence of German film provided new aesthetic principles of artistic production and reception, traditional art forms such as literature, theatre, painting, photography, and music were reframed by a new “cinematic imagination.” Engaging with the work of cultural theorists who first witnessed the impact of film, photography, radio, and gramophone, the course also explores recent interdisciplinary scholarship in media studies to understand how new technologies shape social and political concerns.

As a foundational idea in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic theology, the Garden of Eden spawned a history of interpretation that helped differentiate these religions. The representation of Eden in painting and sculpture is closely entwined with the history of garden design, and this seminar examines both. The course introduces fundamental methods of art history as students examine gardens in ancient Mesopotamia, early Christian monasteries, Syrian and Andalusian courtyards, Renaissance altarpieces, Persian court paintings, Mughal tomb complexes, and early American towns.

This course provides a challenging, but accessible, way to understand predictability’s limits, while still appreciating the bedazzling richness of phenomena that only theories which face these limits can possibly describe. The course brings together, in a cohesive whole, ideas about numbers and infinities; the inner working of computing machines; nuances and concessions occurring in model-building; the meaning of randomness and of determinism.

We all spend a lot of time and effort to evaluate and possibly increase our chances of success, or to minimize certain risks. If philosophical discussions about chance and randomness can be traced back to antiquity, probabilistic and statistical concepts appeared more recently in mathematics. The ambition of the theory of chance has been to deal rationally with this elusive notion. Starting with gambling strategies, the theory now applies to the core of almost all scientific and technical fields, including statistical and quantum mechanics, chaotic dynamics, phylogenetics, sociology, economics, risk management, and quality control. We will provide a broad introduction, organized as a journey in the history of ideas.

Language facilitates abstract thinking and enables interpersonal communication. But some tension exists between its individual and social effects. Communication systems are shared, but individuals have distinct identities, experiences, and things to say. They have different versions of a language and do different things with it. At the macro-social level, policy planning, official languages, and language education both help and hinder efforts to promote human understanding and international cooperation. Exploring such contrasting imperatives, the course asks: How does language create and perform identity? How does it reflect social organization and order? How are communication or conflict enabled or affected by language change or the emergence of dialects or social registers? Students will explore research methods to study dynamics of linguistic conformity (social norms and institutions, power dynamics) and individual usage (language acquisition, personal networks, stylistic variation, and social accommodation) that bear on our efforts to understand language as a defining human characteristic.","component":"Seminar","createdAt":"2019-12-09T08:13:13.014Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-09T08:13:13.014Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5dee021c20bd11405a822d27","name":"Intermediate Microeconomics","location":"Campus Center (C2-E050) Loc: Abu Dhabi","school":"NYU Abu Dhabi - Undergrad","units":4,"time":"TuTh 2:40PM - 3:55PM","course_number":18098,"department":"[object Promise] (Economics)","description":"This course introduces the major concepts and tools of modern microeconomic analysis.
